      g-Eclipse - Implementing Workflow Submission

    <h1>Implementing Workflow Submission</h1>  
    <h2>
      Overview
    </h2>
    Once the user has created a workflow, she/he will want to submit it to 
    the grid for execution. The ideal way for her/him to achieve this is by
    just right-clicking on the workflow description and selecting the 
    "Submit" action. This should translate the workflow description to the 
    appropriate job description language and submit it for execution. 
    
    <p>However, this will depend on the grid middleware for which g-Eclipse is 
    being extended as well as the workflow description language and workflow 
    engine supported by that grid middleware.</p>
    
    <p>In the case of the gLite middleware, it was possible to translate the
    g-Eclipse workflow description to a JDL-DAG and submit it to the grid as if 
    it were a regular job. In the case of GRIA however, direct submission of 
    workflows was not possible. Hence, the workflow description was translated 
    to XScufl and then deployed to a GRIA Job Service as an application.</p>
    
    <p>Therefore, to support workflow execution with a new grid middleware, the
    workflow engine supported by that grid middleware should be identified and 
    then a translation mechanism to the workflow description language supported
    by that engine should be developed. Once this is in place, a mechanism to 
    submit the workflow for execution can be developed.</p>
    
    <p>Once a method to submit a workflow for execution is in place, the 
    g-Eclipse Jobs and Job Details Views can be used to monitor the status of
    running workflows.</p>
