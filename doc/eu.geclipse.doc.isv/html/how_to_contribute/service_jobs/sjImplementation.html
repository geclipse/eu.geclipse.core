<title>g-Eclipse - How to implement a submittable service job</title>
</head>

<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<h1>Implementing a submittable service job</h1>
<p>Implementing a new service job in g-Eclipse is quite easy. Service Jobs
framework provides abstract implementations for the most common use cases:
<ul>
  <li><i>1.</i> Sending JSDL representing a service job.</li>
  <li><i>2.</i> Monitoring job status.</li>
  <li><i>3.</i> When job finishes, downloading job output and initiating 
  computing job's result.</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>What is left to the developer is to provide few methods, mainly the ones 
which will:
<ul>
  <li>provide JSDL(s) for submission</li>
  <li>provide information needed to store and check job's status</li>
  <li>compute the result of the service job when grid job
  finishes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Interfaces and abstract implementations</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><code>eu.geclipse.core.model.IServiceJob</code></dt>
  <dd>This is the basic interface for all service implementations in 
  service job framework. However, developers of the service job should use 
  abstract implementation described below.</dd>
  <dt><code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.model.tests.job.AbstractSubmittableServiceJob</code></dt>
  <dd>This abstract implementation of the <code>IServiceJob</code> interface 
  provides useful implementation for the most common use cases: submitting a JSDL,
  starting service job status updater and monitor status of the job, 
  initialize computing of the result when service job finishes. Also see 
  <code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.model.AbstractServiceJob</code>, which
  is used by <code>AbstractSubmittableServiceJob</code>, for useful methods 
  and fields.<br> 
  When extending this abstract class, developer is required to implement 
  several abstract methods, which will provide all informations needed to submit,
  monitor and download outputs of the jobs. Below you can find a list of all 
  required and optional methods to overwrite.
  </dd>
  
</dl>

<h2>Abstract methods</h2> 
<p>Also see 
<code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.model.submittable.job.
AbstractSubmittableServiceJob</code> abstract class for documentation.
</p>

<h3>Initializing service job data</h3> 
<p>This is a very important step. When service job is submitted using Service 
Job Framework several methods of the service job implementation are used to get
needed information about the service job. Below are the methods you need to
implement.</p>
<p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>public void initData()</code></dt>
   <dd>This method is invoked when service job is created. If the service job 
   requires to run some piece of code, this is a good place to perform that 
   operation.</dd>
  <dt><code>public List<String> getServiceJobResourcesNames()</code></dt>
   <dd>Returns list of names of the resources where service job should be run.
   If you don't want to implement this method, the abstract implementation 
   returns value of the <code>serviceJobResources</code> field of the 
   <code>AbstractServiceJob</code>.
   </dd>
  <dt><code>public String getResultType( final String singleServiceJobName )
      </code></dt>
   <dd>Each service job can provide different kinds of results: text, 
   images, charts etc. This method specifies name ( extension ) of the 
   type of result which is returned by this service job.
   </dd>
  <dt><code>public String getRawDataInput( final IGridJobID jobID,
                                      final String resourceName )</dt></code>
   <dd>Every service job, especially the ones which use submission mechanism, 
   need some informations to access the job and its results.
   When implementing this method developer needs to provide string XML 
   containing all of the needed information, for example: ID of the job,
   job service URI which you need to ask about job status, VO used for job 
   submission etc. Developer then need to provide service job specific parsers and
   writers to read and update the informations he needs.<br>
   Also see 
   <code>eu.geclipse.benchmarking.model.service.BenchmarkServiceJob</code> for 
   exemplary XML in case of benchmarking services in gLite, and 
   <code>eu.geclipse.benchmarking.model.service.BenchmarkServiceJobParser</code>
   for XML parser in this case.   
   </dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3>Providing JSDL for submission</h3>
<p>Submittable service jobs are started by submitting appropriate job 
  description to run on specified resource. Developer which will extend 
  <code>AbstractSubmittableServiceJob</code> needs to provide such job 
  description by implementing following method:

<dl>
  <dt><code>public IGridJobDescription getJSDLForSubmission( 
  final String resourceName )</code></dt>
  <dd>
  This method should provide a submittable job description which will be run on 
  <code>resourceName</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>  

Provided job description will be then submitted to a submission service specified
by the <code>submissionService</code> field of the 
<code>AbstractSubmittableServiceJob</code>. If you need to provide submission 
service in different way, you can overwrite 
<code>public IGridJobService getSubmissionService()</code> method.
</p>
<p><i>Note:</i> When using gEclipse UI the standard action "Run Service Job" 
will fetch list of available job submission services of this service job's VO.
User selects one of them and the job is submitted using this submission 
service.</i>
</p>

<h3>Creating middleware specific job ID instance</h3>
<p>Service jobs are middleware-dependant. Since job implementations are quite
different between each middleware, it's service job developer duty to know how
to construct such job ID. To construct such middleware specific job you 
often need additional informations( for example string representing job ID, name
of the VO, etc. ). It's often good idea to get XML containing service job 
specific information by invoking <code>getResultRawData()</code> and parsing
the results.

<dl><dt><code>public IGridJobID createJobID( 
    final SubmittableServiceJobResult serviceJobResult )</code></dt>
    <dd>Method which creates middleware-specific instance of 
    <code>IGridJobID</code> implementation, given the 
    <code>serviceJobResult</code>.
    </dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3>Computing service job result</h3>
<p>After job associated with a service job finishes the corresponding service 
job's implementation of the method <code>computeJobResult( final IGridJobID jobID, 
final IGridJobStatus jobStatus )</code> is invoked. The usual implementation
proceeds as follows:
<ul>
  <li><i>1.</i> Check the <code>jobStatus</code> of the job. For jobs which were not 
  successful go to point number <i>4</i>.</li>
  <li><i>2.</i> Download output(s) of the job.</li>
  <li><i>3.</i> Parse the job results for service job result.</li>
  <li><i>4.</i> Set the result of the service job.</li>
</ul>
When job finishes Service Job Framework sets status of the job as the service
job result. This often is not correct: failed jobs don't necessarily mean that
the service job also fails. Thats why setting the service job result at the
end of <code>computeJobResult</code> method is advised. To set result of the 
job use:

<dl><dt><code>public void setJobResult( final IGridJobID jobID,
                            final Date lastRefreshDate,
                            final String status,
                            final String besStatus )</code>
    </dt>
    <dd>Method used to set <code>status</code> for job with the given 
    <code>jobID</code>, which was read from job service at 
    <code>lastRefreshDate</code>. Last parameter, <code>besStatus</code>,
    should be one of the global job statuses. See 
    <code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.model.ServiceJobStates</code> enumeration class
    for list of available statuses.
    </dd>
</dl>   
</p>
<p><i>Note:</i>Downloading outputs of the job is specific for each middleware. 
Because Service Job Framework is middleware-independent developers need to know 
how to download output of the job having middleware-specific implementation of 
the <code>IGridJobID</code>. For example you can check 
<code>eu.geclipse.benchmarking.model.service.BenchmarkServiceJob</code> class
and <code>protected IFile getOutput( final IGridJobID jobID,
                             final IFolder folder,
                             final String fileName )</code> method how this is 
done in gLite middleware case.
</p>

<h3>Computing test result</h3>   
<p>After the last job of the service job has finished, then whole service job 
result can be computed. This can mean checking if all sub-jobs were finished 
successfully or checking all outputs generated by the sub-jobs. Developer need
to handle this case to compute whole service job result and proceed with the 
result.

<dl><dt><code></code>
  </dt>public void computeServiceJobResult()
    <dd>Method which is invoked after last job of this service job finishes 
    and it's results are computed using 
    <code>computeJobResult(IGridJobID, IGridJobStatus)</code>. This is a method
    which should be used to store the results of the service job in a database 
    or in another modules.
    </dd>
</dl>

</p>

<h2>Exemplary implementations</h2>
All of the current implementations of the submittable service jobs are for 
gLite middleware. Below you can find list of all implementations with references
to the most important classes.

  <h3>Benchmarking of the grid resources</h3>
    <p>This service job is used to benchmark various resources on the grid. 
    User needs to provide file used for benchmarking (you can find 2 benchmarks
    in the <code>eu.geclipse.benchmarking/xml</code> - <i>bonnie.bsx</i> and
    <i>flops.bsx</i>) and additional parameters, if needed. Results are stored
    in local database, and can be viewed using <b>Benchmark View</b>.
    </p>
    <p><dl>
      <dt><code>eu.geclipse.benchmarking.model.service.BenchmarkServiceJob</code></dt>
      <dd>Class extending submittable service job abstraction. You can see
      how does raw input data in either <code>getRawInputData</code> method 
      look like. Also you can check how you can download job output using 
      <code>eu.geclipse.glite.resources.GliteWMSJobID</code> in the method
      <code>IFile getOutput( final IGridJobID jobID,
                             final IFolder folder,
                             final String fileName )</code>.</dd>
      <dt><code>eu.geclipse.benchmarking.model.service.BenchmarkServiceJobParser</code></dt>
      <dd>Parser dedicated to benchmarking. It creates <code>GliteWMSJobID</code>
      from the raw input data XML stored in the service job status file.</dd>
      <dt><code>eu.geclipse.gbdl.ui.wizards.BenchmarkWizard</code></dt>
      <dd>Implementation of 
      <code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.ui.wizard.AbstractServiceJobWizardNode</code>,
      adding benchmarking pages to service job wizard.
    </dl></p>
  <h3>Application deployment and uninstall</h3>
    <p>Application deployment deals with cases of software installation on 
     computing elements(CEs), while uninstall is the reverse problem. User is 
     asked to select target CEs and the appropriate application (in form of a 
     file) he wants to deploy or uninstall.
    </p>
    <p><dl>
      <dt><code>eu.geclipse.glite.servicejob.deployment.DeploymentServiceJob</code></dt>
      <dd>Class extending submittable service job abstraction. Main task is to
      create proper JDL file. You can check also the overwritten 
      <code>run()</code> action to perform some additional tasks just before 
      job submission.</dd>
      <dt><code>eu.geclipse.glite.servicejob.deployment.UninstallServiceJob</code></dt>
      <dd>Similar to previous class, but takes care of uninstalling of the 
      application.</dd>
      <dt><code>eu.geclipse.glite.servicejob.deployment.DeploymentParser</code></dt>
      <dd>Parser for both deployment and uninstall tasks. Beside usual creation
      of job ID from the XML stored on file also parses several other data and
      informations.</dd>
      <dt><code>
        eu.geclipse.glite.ui.servicejob.deployment.GliteDeploymentWizard/GliteUninstallWizard
      </code></dt>
      <dd>Wizard nodes for deployment and uninstall, extending service job wizard
      node abstraction.</dd>
    </dl></p>
  <h3>gLite version</h3>
    <p>This service job was the first implementation of the g-Eclipse service job
     framework. It tests selected resources for installed gLite version.
    </p>
    <p><dl>
      <dt><code>eu.geclipse.glite.servicejob.gliteversion.GliteVersionJobTest</code></dt>
      <dd>Class extending submittable service job abstraction.</dd>
      <dt><code>eu.geclipse.glite.servicejob.gliteversion.GTDLGliteVersionParser</code></dt>
      <dd>Parser for gLite version test.</dd>
    </dl></p>
