<h1>Service job framework concepts</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Service job framework was created mainly to simplify work of grid operators and 
advanced users. These actors are in various interactions with grid - from 
submitting standard jobs and accessing data, through benchmarking and testing 
grid resources to deploying new applications on computing elements. Service job
framework's responsibility is to gather all of the more complicated grid 
interactions in one common view and provide all needed resources to run and see
results of such tasks.
<p>g-Eclipse service job framework introduces two new views: 
<b>Operator's Job</b> and <b>Operator's Job History</b> with actions similar
to <b>Job's View</b>. User can create new Operator's Jobs, submit them, resubmit 
existing jobs and see detailed informations about them, such as all results of 
this service job executions on each of the target resources. To see how running
service jobs and their results are presented, please consult the screenshot below.

<p>We distinguish two types of service jobs based on how the job is executed. 
If the service job is executed as a grid job, we will call it submittable
service job, while the rest of the service jobs will be called basic service 
jobs. Framework provides two abstract classes for this two cases:
<code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.model.AbstractServiceJob</code> and
<code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.model.submittable.job.AbstractSubmittableServiceJob</code>.
When using mentioned abstraction developer is asked to implement only few 
methods needed to perform the service job and get the results 
</p>
<p>We encourage all service job providers to use service job framework to 
introduce their grid tasks into g-Eclipse. As can be see in the examples provided
by g-Eclipse, this integration was successful for application deployment/uninstall,
grid resources benchmarking and few others.
</p>

<h2>UI components</h2>
<p>The UI part of the Service Job Framework is hidden from the developer. For proper 
implementation you only need to implement model classes of the Service 
Job Framework - all views and informations about your job will be presented to
the user using this model classes.</p>
<p>Only UI part you should consider to extend is wizard for your service job. 
To add your service job to the service job wizard (see screenshot below) you need
to contribute to the <code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.servicejobProvider</code>
extension point by creating <i>wizard</i> extension. You will also need to provide
implementation of the 
<code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.ui.wizard.AbstractServiceJobWizardNode</code> abstraction. See
section <a href="sjWizard.html">MISSING LINK</a>

<h2>Submittable service jobs</h2>
Submittable service jobs are all grid tasks that need to submit grid job to 
get results. The usual steps are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>1. Get all requested and optional data about the service job using wizard.
  <li>2. Create job description for each target resource.
  <li>3. Submit the job descriptions to proper job submission service.
  <li>4. Monitor submitted grid jobs.
  <li>5. When grid job finishes, download it's output and compute result.
  <li>6. When all grid jobs finish, compute the result of service job. 
</ul> 
<p>
When writing new submittable service job developer is not required to create 
implementations of all of the above steps from the scratch. In fact, service job
framework provides you with the job submission and monitoring, and it invokes
appropriate methods from the underlying implementations when each grid job finishes.
You are only asked to provide service-specific informations needed to perform
your task on the grid.
