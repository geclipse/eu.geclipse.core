<title>g-Eclipse - How to contribute to Service Job's UI</title>
</head>

<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<h1>Contributing to Service Job's UI</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
As stated in basic concepts of <a href="serviceJobsFramework.html">Service Jobs Framework</a> 
integration with Eclipse's workbench is provided by framework itself. 
All service jobs created by user are listed in <b>Operator's Job View</b> and 
their details can be seen in <b>Operator's Job Details View</b>.  
</p>
<p>The only UI part that service job providers have to take care of when preparing their implementation is <b>Operator's Job Wizard</b>.</p>

<p>
Service Job Framework comes in with wizard container for other Service Job's wizard nodes implementations. It makes use of
Eclipse's WizardSelectionPage and IWizardNode mechanisms. This means that the framework takes the responsibility for opening a general wizard for service jobs and then queries
all available providers' extension points for wizard nodes that will be plugged in into this general wizard. 
This extension point is <b><code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.servicejobProvider</code></b> and information about class implementing
wizard node's functionality is kept in <b><code>wizard</code></b> element of this extension point.
</p>
<h2>Extension point</h2>
<p><dl>
<dt><code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.servicejobProvider</code></dt>
<dd>Please refer to description <a href="../../extension-points/eu_geclipse_servicejob_servicejobProvider.html">here</a>.</dd>
</dl></p>
<h2>Interfaces and abstract implementations</h2>
<p><dl>
<dt><code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.ui.interfaces.IServiceJobWizardNode</code></dt>
<dd>This is basic interface for nodes to be plugged into general Service Job Wizard. Developers are free to implement it, but for
convenience also abstract implementation of this interface was introduced (see below).</dd>
</dl></p>
<p><dl>
<dt><code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.ui.wizard.AbstractServiceJobWizardNode<code></dt>
<dd>This class provides abstract implementation of <code>IServiceJobWizardNode</code> interface. 
It is recommended to extend this class rather then implement <code>IServiceJobWizardNode</code>
especially in cases when wizard should finish with creation of service job's files, as this functionality 
is pre-implemented.</dd>
</dl></p>
<h2>Abstract methods</h2>
<p> Please refer also to <code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.ui.interfaces.IServiceJobWizardNode</code> and 
<code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.ui.wizard.AbstractServiceJobWizardNode</code> for documentation.</p>
<p><dl>
<dt><code>public String getPluginID()</code></dt>
<dd>Method to access ID of plug-in that extends the  eu.geclipse.servicejob.servicejobProvider extension point.</dd>
</dl></p>
<p><dl>
<dt><code>public List<String> getResourcesNames()</code></dt>
<dd>Method to access names of <code>IGridResources</code> that will be objects of
this service jobs. Those names are serialized in .gtdl file. Please note
that after g-Eclipse's restart those names are the only "handlers" to which
contributor has access (names, not <code>IGridResource</code> objects) - so this
list should be constructed this way that names carry all the information
needed to perform service job by contributor's plug-in. This method is
called by main service job framework's plug-in when .gtdl file is being
</dd>
</dl></p>
<p><dl>
<dt><code>public InputStream getServiceJobInputData()</code></dt>
<dd>Method to access file input stream for newly created structural service job.</dd>
</dl></p>
<p><dl>
<dt><code> public String getName()</code></dt>
<dd>Returns name displayed in general Service Job Wizard</dd>
</dl></p>
<p><dl>
<dt><code>public IWizard getWizard()</code></dt>
<dd>Returns the wizard this node stands for.</dd>

<p><dl>
<dt><code>public boolean isContentCreated()</code></dt>
<dd>Returns whether a wizard has been created for this node.</dd>

<h2>Implementing the wizard</h2>
<p>Providing implementation of <code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.ui.interfaces.IServiceJobWizardNode</code> 
through service job's extension point is one thing - another is to implement the wizard's part.
It is out of scope of this documentation to describe Eclipse's wizards mechanism. Please refer to
Eclipse Developers Guide for more technical details of this soultion. Below only the outline of what needs
to be done is presented.
</p>

<p>First of all it is essential to mention that Wizard that will be displayed in general service job wizard is in fact
the object returned by <code>getWizard()</code> method of <code>IServiceJobWizardNode</code> implementation. 
Nevertheless the service job framework architecture requires that this object is the <code>IServiceJobWizardNode</code> implementation 
itself, which is also a convenient solution from developer's point of view. </p>

<p>The above implies that wizard node implementation is at the same time the essential wizard object, so 
it should override <code>addPages()</code> method from Eclipse's Wizard class, as well as any 
other methods of wizard that are essential to ensure functionality to realise provider's use cases.
In <code>addPages()</code> method all necessary wizard pages should be added. As a ready to use wizard page's example
Service Job UI plug-in comes in with <code>eu.geclipse.servicejob.ui.wizard.ResourcesSelectionPage</code> (this will allows
user to select target Grid resources for service job).
