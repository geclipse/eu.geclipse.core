<h1>g-Eclipse - Create a Job</h1>

<p> In order to submit a job to the Grid, you first need a file that 
describes your job with vital information such as the name of the executable, the input and output 
parameters, etc. This file is usually in the Job Submission Description 
Language (JSDL). As composing this manually is laborious and time consuming, 
you can use the g-Eclipse Grid Job Wizard to create such a file.</p>

<p>Go to <a class="command-link" 
href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.newWizard(newWizardId=eu.geclipse.ui.wizards.gridJobWizard)")'>

<b>File &gt; New &gt; Job Description</b></a>.
(Alternatively, you could right-click into the Grid Project View and choose <b>New &gt; Job Description</b>.) 
A dialog opens up where you can specify the name of the job description file you are about to create 
and where you would like to save it. Choose the <b>Job Description</b> folder of your Grid Project and 
type in the name you would like to give your jsdl file. </p>

<p>Clicking <b>Next</b> will take you to a page where you can identify your application by name,
  choose the executable you would like to run, and provide any optional arguments. You can also specify filenames
  for the standard input, output and error (stdin, stdout and stderr). </p>

<p>Clicking <b>Next</b> will take you to a page where you can choose the location of any input and output files required 
/ produced by your executable. You can specify multiple input and output files with associated settings.</p>

Files Dialog" width="465">

<p> Clicking <b>Finish</b> will create the job description file in the Grid Projects View and open it in the 
JSDL Editor. In the various tabs of the editor, you can add further information to your job description. 
The last tab of the editor shows the actual JSDL description of your job.</p>
