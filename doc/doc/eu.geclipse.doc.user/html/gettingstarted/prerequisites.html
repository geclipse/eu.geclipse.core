<h1>g-Eclipse Prerequisites</h1>

<p> The g-Eclipse framework will aid access to emerging Grid infrastructures in 
science and in business. Distributed Grid infrastructures are gaining popularity 
worldwide, especially in scientific research. Grid infrastructures are distributed
resources, which are connected by a Middleware layer. This Middleware layer provides
a secure and seamless access to distributed computing and storage resources. 
The distributed resources are managed by central services such as resource brokers and 
data replication management systems. Access to resources is granted by the 
membership in a so called 'Virtual Organisation' (VO). Such Virtual Organisations  
and their resources can be seen as a "Virtual Computing Center".</p>

<p>A g-Eclipse user must fulfill a few prerequisites to get access to the emerging 
Grid infrastructures for e-Science.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The user must possess an X.509 certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA), 
	which is recognized by the EUGridPMA. The list of EUGridPMA conformant CA's can be found 
	<a href="http://www.eugridpma.org/members/">here</a>. 
	If you need such an X.509 certificate, contact your national CA. The X.509 certificate 
	and the corresponding key are stored on the user's computer. </li>
	<li>The user is a member of a Virtual Organisation, which is supported by a Grid
	infrastructure project. The manager of such a Virtual Organisation can grant 
	membership to a Virtual Organisation. g-Eclipse supports the "Virtual 
	Organisation Membership System" 
	(<a href="http://hep-project-grid-scg.web.cern.ch/hep-project-grid-scg/voms.html">VOMS</a>).</li>
	<li>The user's Virtual Organisation is supported by Grid resource providers, who 
	use the same Middleware. g-Eclipse currently supports the 
	<a href="http://glite.web.cern.ch/glite/">gLite</a> Middleware from the 
	<a href="http://www.eu-egee.org/">EGEE</a> project. 
	The support for other Middleware systems is planned for the end of 2007. </li>
</ul>
<p>When the above prerequisites are fulfilled, you can start using the
g-Eclipse framework to "Access the power of the Grid".  </p>
<p>In case you don't have access to a real Grid infrastructure within your organisation, 
you can benefit from the <a href="https://gilda.ct.infn.it/testbed.html">GILDA</a> 
training infrastructure. This infrastructure relies on the gLite Middleware and 
is open for everybody. If you want to get access this infrastructure, you have to 
perform a few steps. These steps are described in the section
