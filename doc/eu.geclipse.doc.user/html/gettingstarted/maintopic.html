<h1>g-Eclipse - Getting started </h1>
<p>After you downloaded and started the g-Eclipse framework, you will see the 
common Eclipe welcome page. You can use documentation links there to get more 
information, or you just close the welcome menu by clicking on the tab.
<br>

</p>

<p> You get clean workspace and the Eclipse workbench looks probably like the 
next picture - you got a perspective containing different views. <br><br>

<h2>Create the first Grid project</h2>

<p>
In order to create a first Grid project, you select 
<b>File &gt; New &gt; Project..." </b>and get the New Projects Wizard. Select under the
folder "g-Eclipse" the item "New Grid Project". Then click "Next" and 
you enter the name of your Grid Project and click on <b>Next</b>.<br><br>

</p>

<p>
On the next page the wizard asks you to select the <b>Virtual Organisation 
(VO)</b> for your project. The Grid model of the g-Eclipse framework requires
a Virtual Organisation for every Grid Project. You can not continue with a Grid
project without the definition of a <b>Virtual Organisation</b>. Find more 
information about the idea and the management of VOs in the g-Eclipse framework
at the  
<a href="../concepts/setup/vosettings/vosettings.html">concept section</a> and 
in the help system under the topic Middlewares.  
As we start from a plain workspace there is no VO at the beginning so we define
the VO first by selecting <b>Edit VOs...</b>. You will be directed to the 
VO preference page of the g-Eclipse framework where you then enter the 
parameters of your VO.  Assuming that you define the VO 
for the infrastructure you want to use, the user come back with at least one VO. 
and the wizards shows at least one VO (i.e. the AmazonWebServices). Select the 
VO with the Checkbox and click <b>Next</b><br><br>

</p>
<p>
On the last page of the Wizard you can define the structure of your Grid project, 
but for the first start just click <b>Finish</b>.<br><br<>

<br><br>
Then the Grid project is created and the g-Eclipse frameworks changes to the 
<b>Grid user perspective</b> with the following dialog. Click <b>Yes</b> and the 
Grid user perspective will opened.

<h2> The Grid use perspective </h2>
The main view in the Grid user perspective is the Grid project View, which is 
shown on the left side of the next image. It provides the logical view to the 
virtualised infrastructure of any Grid project. It contains the standard folders 
defined above and the node representing the Virtual Organisation (in our example
it is called AmazonWebServies).At startup, the central part of the workbench, the editor, is empty. Depending on the action you start, 
you will get the corresponding editor in the Editor area.

You can unfold the created project like every other Eclipse project. The project contains

 <p>Before you can start interacting with the Grid, you need to set up your g-Eclipse 
 environment. The following configuration is necessary:</p>

  Certificate Authorities</a>. </li>

 are a member</a>. </li>
