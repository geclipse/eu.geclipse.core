<h1>g-Eclipse - Getting started </h1>
<p>After you downloaded and started the g-Eclipse framework, you will see the 
common Eclipe welcome page. You can use documentation links there to get more 
information, or you just close the welcome menu by clicking on the tab.
<br>

</p>

<p> You get clean workspace and the Eclipse workbench looks probably like the 
next picture - you got a perspective containing different views. <br><br>

</p>

<h2>Create the first Grid project</h2>

<p>
In order to create a first Grid project, you select 
<b>File &gt; New &gt; Project..." </b>and get the New Projects Wizard. Select under the
folder "g-Eclipse" the item "New Grid Project". Then click "Next" and 
you enter the name of your Grid Project and click on <b>Next</b>.<br><br>
<a href="images/gridproject_wizard_name.jpg"><img src="images/gridproject_wizard_name.jpg" alt="Eclipse Welcome Window"></a>
</p>

<p>
On the next page the wizard asks you to select the <b>Virtual Organisation 
(VO)</b> for your project. The Grid model of the g-Eclipse framework requires
a Virtual Organisation for every Grid Project. You can not continue with a Grid
project without the definition of a <b>Virtual Organisation</b>. Find more 
information about the idea and the management of VOs in the g-Eclipse framework
at the  
<a href="../concepts/setup/vosettings/vosettings.html">concept section</a> and 
in the help system under the topic Middlewares.  
As we start from a plain workspace there is no VO at the beginning so we define
the VO first by selecting <b>Edit VOs...</b>. You will be directed to the 
VO preference page of the g-Eclipse framework where you then enter the 
parameters of your VO.  Assuming that you define the VO 
for the infrastructure you want to use, the user come back with at least one VO. 
and the wizards shows at least one VO (i.e. the AmazonWebServices). Select the 
VO with the Checkbox and click <b>Next</b><br><br>

</p>
<p>
On the last page of the Wizard you can define the structure of your Grid project, 
but for the first start just click <b>Finish</b>.<br><br<>
<a href="images/gridproject_wizard_folders.jpg"><img src="images/gridproject_wizard_folders.jpg" alt="g-Eclipse Project Wizard Folders"></a>
<br><br>
Then the Grid project is created and the g-Eclipse frameworks changes to the 
<b>Grid user perspective</b> with the following dialog. Click <b>Yes</b> and the 
Grid user perspective will opened.

<br><br>
<h2> The Grid use perspective </h2>
The main view in the Grid user perspective is the Grid project View, which is 
shown on the left side of the next image. It provides the logical view to the 
virtualized infrastructure of any Grid project. It contains the standard folders 
defined above and the node representing the Virtual Organisation (in our example
it is called AmazonWebServies).At startup, the central part of the workbench, the 
editor, is empty. But depending on the edit action you start, you will get the 
corresponding editor in the Editor area. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
More details about Grid and Cloud projects can be found under in the 
<a href="../concepts/gridproject/creating.html">concept section</a>
and under the middleware specific sections. 
</p>
<h2> The Grid Project View</h2>
The center of each Grid project is the Grid projects is the Grid project view. 
The vitualized structure of the Project View contains local and remote resources. 
One of the tree items in the view is the Virtual Organisation of the project. 
Under that tree item the available Grid and Cloud resources are shown to the 
user. I.e. a Virtual Organisation for AWS services contains the children 
Computing, Services and Storage. These children are common for each VO 
independent of the middleware used. But the interactions might slightly differ. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2> Security on Grids and Clouds</h2>
Grid and Cloud infrastructures are remote resources on which a user must 
authenticate himself. Furthermore, an authorisation framework manages the 
access rights of the user. In order to interact with a remote service, the user 
must possess a valid authentication token. The g-Eclipse framework has a smart
framework to manage these tokens. Whenever the user access a Grid/Cloud service, 
the framework checks if such a service exists. If not, then the input page for 
the according token pops up. I.e. if the user opens the <b>Storage</b> item the
following input page pops-up. Enter the security information for the 
used middleware (i.e. enter the AWS access key).  
<br><br>
<a href="images/gridtoken_input.jpg"><img src="images/gridtoken_input.jpg" alt="g-Eclipse Project Wizard Folders"></a>
<br><br>
More Information about the g-Eclipse Security and Authentication framework can 
be found in the 
<a href="../concepts/gridauthentication/creating.html">concept section</a>
and in the middleware specific sections. 


<p>At startup, the central part of the workbench, the editor, is empty. Depending on the action you start, 
you will get the corresponding editor in the Editor area.</p>

 <p>Before you can start interacting with the Grid, you need to set up your g-Eclipse 
 environment. The following configuration is necessary:</p>
 <ul>
   <li> <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.doc.user/html/concepts/setup/cacertifitcates.html">Download the certificates of the approved 
  Certificate Authorities</a>. </li>
   <li> <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.doc.user/html/concepts/setup/vosettings.html">Declare the Virtual Organisation(s), of which you 
 are a member</a>. </li>
   <li> <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.doc.user/html/concepts/gridauthentication/creating.html">Locate your Grid Certificate and 
 generate Grid Authentication Tokens</a>.</li>
   <li> <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.doc.user/html/concepts/gridproject/creating.html">Create a new Grid Project</a>. </li>
   <li> <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.doc.user/html/concepts/jobmanagement/creatingJSDL.html">Create a new Grid Job</a>.</li>
