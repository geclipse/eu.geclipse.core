<h1>Scientific Data Visualisation using g-Eclipse</h1>
<h2>Specifying VTK Pipeline Content</h2>

<p>
<b>This page explains the VTK Pipeline editor. Note that this work is in progress and 
more information is being added periodically.</b>
</p> 

<p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Have created a VTK Pipeline file (*.vtkpipeline). Refer to 
 <a href="CreatingVtkPipelineFile.html">Creating VTK Pipeline File</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> If the VTK Pipeline editor is not already opened, double-click on the 
VTK Pipeline file that was created using the VTK Pipeline wizard.
</br>
The editor opens up at the overview page that links to the additional editor pages.
You can see the VTK Pipeline in its raw form in the last page of the editor. You will 
notice that it is an XML file. You may chose to edit this file directly in its raw 
form, however, it is recommended that you use the additional editor pages in order to
guarantee that the file its structure is valid at all time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Click on the DataSource link from the Overview page or select the tab labelled 
Data Source Page.</br>
Under the Data Source Section, you will be able to change the data file location, and 
the type of the data. </br>
Under the Data Reader Section, you will be able to change the VTK reader class and 
add and specify parameters for it. </br> Based on your selection of the data type input
a list of a number of less often changed parameters, which you will be able to predefine 
on the Visualisation preference page, will be shown. However, you will still be able to 
adjust every one of the parameters for the current VTK Pipeline from within this place 
of the editor.</br>
This page is in development and therefore for now, any changes you make will not take 
effect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Click on the DataProcessing link from the Overview page or select the tab labelled 
Data Processing Page. </br>
On this page you will be able to change the output format. Again based on your selection 
of the output format, a list of a number of less often changed parameters will be shown. 
And again, you will be able to adjust every one of the parameters for the current 
VTK Pipeline from within this place of the editor.</br>
This page is in development and therefore for now, any changes you make will not take 
effect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 4:</b> Click on the VTKFilter link from the Overview page or select the tab labelled 
VTK Filter Algorithm Page. </br>
On this page you will be able to add filter algorithms and set their respective 
attributes.</br>
This page is in development and therefore for now, any changes you make will not take 
effect. 
</p>

<p>
As the specification of a data processing pipeline may get quite complex, with many 
filters connecting to one another, the definition of the algorithms may become cumbersome 
with if only the text editor is available. Therefore, in the final state of the g-Eclipse 
Visualisation module, the need is to include a graphical editor as part of this text 
editor.
