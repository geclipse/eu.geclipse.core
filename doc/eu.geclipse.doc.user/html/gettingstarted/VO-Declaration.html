</head>

<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<h1>Virtual Organisation Declaration</h1>

<h3>If you already belong to one or more VO's :</h3>
<p>If you already belong to a Virtual Organisation supported by the EGEE infrastructure, you will
   need your VO's settings such as <i>Name</i>, <i>Host</i>, <i>Port</i>, <i>Host DN</i> and 
   <i>Information System Endpoint</i> in order to continue. This information can be requested 
   from the manager of your VO.
</p>

<h3>If you do not currently belong to any VO :</h3>
<p>If you would like to test and use  g-Eclipse, but do not have access to an
existing Grid infrastructure, you can request membership to the Training VO
'geclipsetutor'. This Training-VO is supported by the 
<a href="https://gilda.ct.infn.it/testbed.html">GILDA Testbed</a>. The following
action needs to be performed. 
<ol>
<li> Get your personal GILDA certificate. <br>
The security on Grid is currently based on X.509 certificates. To get access to the 
geclipsetutor VO, you need to get a temporary certifcate from the GILDA Certification 
Authority (GILDA CA). Detailed instructions can be found 
<a href="https://gilda.ct.infn.it/step1.html">here</a>. Is is important to know, that
the whole procedure can take 12-24 hours and includes more than just one step.
But at the end of the procedure, your personnel GILDA certificate is installed in your 
webbrowser and the files "usercert.pem" and userkey.pem" are stored in a dedicated 
directory on your hard disk. 

<li> Accept the Use Policy of the GILDA testbed <br>
Due to legal reasons, every user has to agree on the "Acceptable user Policy" of the 
GILDA testbed. This can be done <a href="https://gilda.ct.infn.it/aup.php">here</a>. 

<li>  Register to the Virtual Organization "geclipsetutor" <br>
With the first two steps finished, your are ready to ask for membership in the Virtual
Organisation "geclipsetutor". Therefore goto the 
<a href="https://dgrid-voms.fzk.de:8443/voms/geclipsetutor/">VOMS webpage</a> 
(https://dgrid-voms.fzk.de:8443/voms/geclipsetutor/) of this VO. Be aware that you must 
perform this with the same browser you used to request your personel GILDA certificate.  
Your request will be evaluated by the "geclipsetutor" VO managers and you will receive 
three emails: the first one to confirm your email address, the second one to let you 
know that your request is going to be processed, and the third one to let you know 
that your request has been accepted.  

<li> Then you should be ready to use the g-Eclipse framework to access the GILDA 
training Grid infrastructure. As there are manual interactions neccessary. the whole 
procedure might take some time, but this will allow you to evaluate the power of the
g-Eclipse framework and of the underlying Grid infrastructure. 
</ol>

<p>Now, you can return to the g-Eclipse framework, and continue with the setup of your
VO (geclipsetutor or another). </p>

<h3>Enter the VO configuration data:</h3>
<p> Open the <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=eu.geclipse.ui.internal.preference.VOPreferencePage)")'>
<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
<b>g-Eclipse &gt; VO-Declarations</b></a> preference page. </p>

<p> Click on the <b>Add</b> button and, in the dialog that opens, put in the VO specific settings 
such as Name, Host, Port, Host DN, and Information System Endpoint. Click <b>Finish</b> when done. 
<br/>(Note: Ensure you enter the name of the VO exactly as you see it : 'geclipsetutor' is not the
same as 'g-EclipseTutor'.)</p>

to complete the process.</p>
