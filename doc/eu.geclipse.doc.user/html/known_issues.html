<h1>g-Eclipse - Known Issues</h1>

<ul>
<li><h4>Firewalls:</h4>
g-Eclipse has the same connectivity requirements as any other client
software for a specific grid middleware. Therefore you will need to be able
to establish outgoing TCP connections to a series of ports, and in a
few cases also allow some incoming open ports. Check the middleware
specific documentation for more details.
</li>
<li><h4>Changes in Job Description are not reflected immediately in Properties view:</h4>
If you modify a JSDL file, then the Properties view will still show old values for the job description. 
You have to restart g-Eclipse to see the updated values. 
Despite this, the modified (correct) job description will be used for job submission even without 
having to restart g-Eclipse.   
</li>
<li><h4>ProcessStatusView only shows anonymous pid-lists:</h4>
The current implementation of the Process Status View started with the Action: "Monitor Computing Resource"
will only display anonymous pid-lists of the remote resources as long as the GridFTP connection to the
remote host is successful. Full functionality is going to be available for the 1.0.0 Release.
</li>
<li><h4>Known Issues with Mac OS X:</h4>
Sometimes, collapsing the tree in the Grid Project View or the Glue Information
Viewer will either not redraw the tree, or, in some cases, cause the application to crash.
<h5>VO Management:</h5>
Web View using HTTPS does not work on Mac OS X.
</li>
<li><h4>JSDL Editor Issues:</h4>
<h5>Input field validations:</h5>
The current implementation of the JSDL editor does not provide input field validation
therefore, the user must provide correct input as per the JSDL Specification v.1.0.
Input guidelines are given on the <a href="concepts/jobmanagement/editingJSDL.html"> help pages</a>
 of the respective JSDL editor pages.
<h5>File System and Additional Resources Sections Functionality:</h5>
The current implementation of the JSDL editor provides limited functionality for
manipulating the elements under the File System and Additional Resources
Elements sections of the Resources Page. 
</li>
<li><h4>Workflow Builder</h4>
The workflow builder is sometimes unstable and it does not yet have the full functionality to 
allow submission to a grid middleware.
</li>
</ul>
