<h1>g-Eclipse - Known Issues</h1>

<ul>
<li><h4>Firewalls:</h4>
g-Eclipse has the same connectivity requirements as any other client
software for that grid middleware. Therefore you will need to be able
to establish outgoing TCP connections to a series of ports, and in a
few cases also allow some incoming open ports. Check the middleware
specific documentation for more details.
</li>
<li><h4>Changes in Job Description are not reflected immediately in Properties view:</h4>
If you modify jsdl file, then Properties view will show still old values for job description. 
You have to restart g-Eclipse to see new values. 
Despite of it, modify (correct) job description will be used for job submission even without g-Eclipse restarting.   
</li>
</ul>
