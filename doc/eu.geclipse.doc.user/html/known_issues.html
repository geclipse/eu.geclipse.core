<h1>g-Eclipse - Known Issues</h1>

<ul>
<li><h4>Firewalls:</h4>
g-Eclipse has the same connectivity requirements as any other client
software for that grid middleware. Therefore you will need to be able
to establish outgoing TCP connections to a series of ports, and in a
few cases also allow some incoming open ports. Check the middleware
specific documentation for more details.
</li>
<li><h4>Changes in Job Description are not reflected immediately in Properties view:</h4>
If you modify jsdl file, then Properties view will show still old values for job description. 
You have to restart g-Eclipse to see new values. 
Despite of it, modify (correct) job description will be used for job submission even without g-Eclipse restarting.   
</li>
<li><h4>ProcessStatusView only shows anonymous pid-lists:</h4>
The current implementation of the Process Status View started with the Action: "Monitor Computing Resource"
will only display anonymous pid-lists of the remote resources as long as the GridFTP connection to the
remote host is successful. Full functionality is going to be available for the 1.0.0 Release
</li>
<li><h4>VO Management:</h4>
Web View using HTTPS doesn't work on Mac OS X.
</li>
<li><h4>Known Issues with Mac OS X:</h4>
Sometimes, collapsing the tree in the Grid Project View or the Glue Information
Viewer will either cause the application to crash or make it not redraw the tree.
</li>
<li><h4>JSDL Editor Issues:</h4>
<h5>Input field validations:</h5>
The current implementation of the JSDL editor does not provide input field validation
therefore, the user must provide correct input as per the JSDL Specification v.1.0.
Input guidelines are given on the <a href="concepts/jobmanagement/editingJSDL.html"> help pages</a>
 of the respective JSDL editor pages.
<h5>File System and Additional Resources Sections Functionality:</h5>
The current implementation of the JSDL editor provides limited functionality for
manipulating the elements under the File System and Additional Resources
Elements sections of the Resources Page.
