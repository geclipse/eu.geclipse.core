<h1>g-Eclipse - Known Issues</h1>

<ul>
<li><h4>Firewalls:</h4>
g-Eclipse has the same connectivity requirements as any other client
software for a specific grid middleware. Therefore you will need to be able
to establish outgoing TCP connections to a series of ports, and in a
few cases also allow some incoming open ports. Check the middleware
specific documentation for more details.
</li>

<li><h4>JSDL Editor Issues:</h4>
<h5>Input field validations:</h5>
The current implementation of the JSDL editor does not provide input field validation
therefore, the user must provide correct input as per the JSDL Specification v.1.0.
Input guidelines are given on the <a href="concepts/jobmanagement/editingJSDL.html"> help pages</a>
of the respective JSDL editor pages.
<h5>Additional Resources Sections Functionality:</h5>
The Additional Resources Elements section of the Resources Page provides
limited functionality.
</li>
<li><h4>Workflow Component</h4>
The '.workflow' extension has to be typed in for the Workflow to be created and opened for editing in the
Workflow Editor. JSDL files can be dragged and dropped directly onto existing workflow jobs to associate
them with your workflow; drag and drop of JSDL files directly onto the workflow editor is not yet supported.
</li>
</ul>
