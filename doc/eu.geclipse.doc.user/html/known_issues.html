<h1>g-Eclipse - Known Issues</h1>

<ul>
<li><h4>Firewalls:</h4>
g-Eclipse has the same connectivity requirements as any other client
software for a specific grid middleware. Therefore you will need to be able
to establish outgoing TCP connections to a series of ports, and in a
few cases also allow some incoming open ports. Check the middleware
specific documentation for more details.
</li>

<li><h4>PKCS#12 keystores loading:</h4>
If you want to be able to use PKCS#12 formated keystores (<b>.p12</b> files)
then you may need to install the JCE unrestricted policy files in your Java
installation:
  <ul>
  <li>
  download the "Java Cryptography Extension Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction
  Policy Files" from
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads</a>
  (or the corresponding site if you have another Java version)
  </li>
  <li>
  unpack that file and follow the instructions in the README. You only need to copy
  the two policy files into the right path in your Java installation, namely:
  <b>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security</b>
  </li>
  </ul>
See also <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/documentation.html">the
Bouncycastle documentation</a> for more information.
</li>

<li><h4>JSDL Editor Issues:</h4>
<h5>Input field validations:</h5>
The current implementation of the JSDL editor does not provide input field validation
therefore, the user must provide correct input as per the JSDL Specification v.1.0.
Input guidelines are given on the <a href="concepts/jobmanagement/editingJSDL.html"> help pages</a>
of the respective JSDL editor pages.
<h5>Additional Resources Sections Functionality:</h5>
The Additional Resources Elements section of the Resources Page provides
limited functionality.
</li>

<li><h4>Workflow Component:</h4>
There are some known synchronisation issues when performing actions on the
workflow subjobs, folders, job-descriptions, etc. from different sides:
  <ul>
  <li>
  Adding and removing data-staging in workflow JSDLs have any changes
  reflected in the graphical workflow job's ports, however this behaviour is
  does not happen in reverse, i.e., changes in workflow ports (added or
  removed) are not reflected by changes in the related JSDL's data-staging
  information.
  </li>
  <li>
  Updating a workflow JSDL will cause existing links between jobs to be
  broken. However, they can easily be re-connected again through using the
  'Calculate Job Dependencies' action.
  </li>
  <li>
  Renaming of workflow JSDLs that are linked to a graphical workflow job
  will cause the graphical job's reference to the JSDL file to be removed.
  </li>
  <li>
  Renaming the .workflow folder or enclosed .workflow file will cause errors
  if both folder and file are of different names.
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
