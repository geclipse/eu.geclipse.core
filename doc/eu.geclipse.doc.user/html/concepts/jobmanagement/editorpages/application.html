<h1>g-Eclipse - JSDL Editor - Application Page</h1>

<p>The Application page provides an interface for manipulating the application
and its requirements. It consists of three sections: the <b>Application</b>, the
<b>POSIX Application</b> and <b>Additional POSIX Application elements</b>.</p>

<h2>Application Section </h2>

<p>This section allows to manipulate the <b>Application</b> element of a JSDL document.
This elememt is a generic container that holds specific application definitions, 
such as POSIX applications defined in the POSIX Application section. </p>

<p> An <b> Application Name </b> is optional and defines the name of the application,
independantly of the location of it's executable. The Application Name is of 
type "String".</p>

<p> An <b> Application Version </b> is optional and defines the version of the application,
that is to be executed. If left empty this means that any version of the application can
be executed. The Application Version is of type "String".</p>

<p> An <b> Application Description </b> is optional is optional and provides, 
human readable, description about the application. The Application Version is of
type "String".</p>

<h2>POSIX Application Section </h2>

<p> This section allows to manipulate the <b>POSIXApplication</b> element of a JSDL document.
This elememt is an extension to the JSDL <b>Application</b> element and it's used to describe
POSIX style applications. </p>

<p> A <b>POSIX Application </b> is optional and defines the name of the POSIX
Application. </p>

<p> An <b> Executable</b> is optional and specifies the executable of the application
to be executed. If not specified along with the <b>ApplicationName</b> element 
above then this could suggest a null or a data staging job.</p>

<p> An <b>Argument</b> is optional and provides argument for the application to 
be executed. In the Arguments list one or more arguments can be specified for the
application. Arguments are of type "String".</p>

<p> Press <b>Add...</b> for opening an input dialog to insert an argument. The 
<b>File System Name</b> specifies the name of a file system. This name of a 
file system is defined by the <b>FileSystem</b> element of a JSDL document. 
Using the JSDL editor, you can define the file system name in the
<a href="editorpages/resources.html"> File System section of Resources Page</a>.

<p> Press <b>Edit...</b> to change the details of the selected argument. Press 
<b>Remove</b> to remove the selected argument.</p>

<p> A <b>Standard Input File</b> is optional and specifies the standard input of
the application to be executed. The input filename is relative to the
working directory or the file system name if this is specfied. The Standard Input
File is of type "String".</p>

<p> A <b>Standard Output File</b> is optional and specifies the standard output of
the application to be executed. The output filename is relative to the
working directory or the file system name if this is specfied. The Standard Output
File is of type "String".</p>

<p> A <b>Standard Error File</b> is optional and specifies the standard error of
the application to be executed. The standard error filename is relative to the
working directory or the file system name if this is specfied. The Standard Error
File is of type "String".</p>

<p> An <b>Environmental Variable</b> is optional and defines the name and value
of an environment variable that needs to be specified for the execution of the job
on the consuming system.</p>

<p> Press <b>Add...</b> for opening an input dialog to insert an environmental 
variable. The Environmental Variable name and value are of type "String". 
Press <b>Edit...</b> to change the details of the selected environmental
variable. Press <b>Remove</b> to remove the selected variable.</p> 

<h2> Additional POSIX Application Elements </h2>

<p> This section allows you to provide additional information about the requirements
of the POSIX style application to be executed.</p>

<p> A <b> Working Directory</b> is optional and specifies the starting directory 
required by the job to execute. The Working Directory if of type "String".</p>

<p> A <b> Wall Time Limit</b> is optional and specifies in seconds the limit of 
the application execution duration. The Wall Time Limit is of type "Non-Negative
Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> File Size Limit</b> is optional and specifies in bytes the maximum size 
of any file related to the job. The File Size Limit is of type "Non-Negative
Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Core Dump Limit</b> is optional and specifies in bytes the maximum size 
of core dumps a job may create. The Core Dump Limit is of type "Non-Negative
Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Data Segmentation Limit</b> is optional and specifies in bytes the maximum
limit of data segments. The  Data Segmentation Limit is of type "Non-Negative
Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Locked Memory Limit</b> is optional and specifies in bytes the maximum
amount of physical memory the job is allowed to lock. The Locked Memory Limit
is of type "Non-Negative Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Memory Limit</b> is optional and specifies in bytes the maximum
amount of physical memory the job should use when executing. The Memory Limit
is of type "Non-Negative Integer".</p>

<p> An <b> Open Descriptor Limit</b> is optional and specifies the maximum
amount of open file-descriptors (files, pipes, sockets) the job can have.
The Open Descriptors Limit is of type "Non-Negative Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Pipe Size Limit</b> is optional and specifies in bytes the maximum
size of pipelines created by the job processing. The Pipe Size Limit
is of type "Non-Negative Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Stack Size Limit</b> is optional and specifies in bytes the maximum
size of the execution stack. The Stack Size Limit is of type "Non-Negative 
Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> CPU Time Limit</b> is optional and specifies in seconds the maximum
number of CPU time seconds the job is allowed to consume. The Stack Size Limit
is of type "Non-Negative Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Process Count Limit</b> is optional and specifies the maximum
number of processes the job can spawn. The Process Count Limit is of type 
"Non-Negative Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Virtual Memory Limit</b> is optional and specifies in bytes the maximum
amount of virtual memory the job can allocate. The Virtual Memory Limit
is of type "Non-Negative Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> Thread Count Limit</b> is optional and specifies the maximum
amount of threads the job is allowed to create. The Thread Count Limit
is of type "Non-Negative Integer".</p>

<p> A <b> User Name</b> is optional and specifies the user name to be used when 
executing the application. The User Name is of type "String".</p>

<p> A <b> Group Name</b> is optional and specifies the group name to be used when 
executing the application. The Group Name is of type "String".</p>
