<h1>g-Eclipse - JSDL Editor - Resources Page</h1>

<p> The Resources page provides an interface for specifying the resource requirements
of the job. It consists of five sections: the <b>Candidate Hosts</b>, the 
<b>Operating System</b>, the <b>File System</b> , the <b>CPU Architecture</b> and
the <b>Additional Resources Elements </b>.</p>

<h2>Candidate Hosts</h2>

<p>The section allows to manipulate the <b>CandidateHosts</b> element of a JSDL 
document. This element specifies a lists of hosts that can be selected for running
the job.</p>
