<h1>g-Eclipse - JSDL Editor - Data Staging Page</h1>

<p> The Data Staging page provides an interface for specifying which files 
should be moved to the execution host (<b>stage-in</b>) before the job starts executing,
and which files should be moved from the execution host (<b>stage-out</b>) after the 
job is executed.</p>

<h1>Staged-In Files</h1>
