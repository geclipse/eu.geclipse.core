<h1>g-Eclipse - Editing a Job Description</h1>

<p> After you have created a Job Description using the New Job Description
wizard, you may decide to apply some changes to it or even provide additional 
information. Since editing the Job Description file manually is a time consuming
process requiring knowledge of the JSDL language, a JSDL editor is provided in 
g-Eclipse to ease this task. The JSDL editor is the default editor and viewer
for JSDL files in the g-Eclipse framework. JSDL file have the *.jsdl extension.</p>

<p>
Once you finish creating a new Job Description with the New Job Description
Wizard, the JSDL editor opens in the center workbench view and loads automatically
the newly created file.
