<h1>g-Eclipse - Defining Application Parameters</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Application Parameters allow user to define extension of New Job
Wizard in form of additional wizard's pages without writing even single
line of programming code. From user's point of view this is declarative
mechanism based on XML files.</p>
<p>If any Application Parameters are defined they will be displayed
on Executable page in New Job Wizard in <i>Application name</i> list (by
application name parameter). Choosing one of the applications from the
list will result in adding new pages to wizard (defined by XML file
associated with Application Parameters). If not empty JSDL file is set
for Application Parameters it will be used as a base for creating new
job description by Wizard.</p>

<h3>Defining Application Parameters</h3>
<p>Application Parameters can be defined using <i>Window >
Preferences > g-Eclipse > Application Parameters</i> menu, by providing the
following information:
<ul>
	<li><i>Application Name</i> - name of the application, it will be
	listed on Executable page in New Job Wizard in the <i>Application
	name</i> list
	<li><i>Application Path</i> - path to the executable file of the
	application. This should be absolute path on the host on which
	application is to be launched. This parameter is optional.
	<li><i>XML Path</i> - absolute path to the local XML file
	describing additional New Job Wizard content. This XML is defined by <code>ui_definition.xsd"</code>
	schema file located in <code>eu.geclipse.jsdl.ui</code> plug-in in <code>xml</code>
	subdirectory.
	<li><i>JSDL Path</i> - path to the local JSDL file. This file is
	used as a base file when creating new JSDL file in New Job Wizard. If
	some of the fields for which Wizard's fields provide input are defined
	in this file the corresponding fields in Wizard will be pre-populated
	with values taken from this JSDL file.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Additional wizard's pages definition</h3>
<p>Any extra wizard's pages should be defined in XML file passed to application
parameters through <i>XML Path</i> field in Preferences dialog. This XML is
described by <code>ui_definition</code> (this file can be found in
<code>eu.geclipse.jsdl.ui/xml/</code>) XSD document.</p>
<p>The basic document structure, listing main XML elements is described below.
Please refer to XSD document for detailed information.
<ul>
  <li><code>pluginPages</code> - XML document root element, within it <code>page</code>
  elements are contained
  <li><code>page</code> - each <code>page</code> element defines new wizard's page.
  Graphical components of page should be defined inside this element.
  Elements components supported by parametric wizard extensions are the
  following:
  <ul>
    <li><code>text</code> - defines simple text filed
    (<code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text</code>). As a children of this XML element
    also <code>label</code> and <code>paramName</code> elements should be created. The
    first of them represents <code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label</code> widget that
    will precede text component with field description. <code>paramName</code> stands
    for JSDL element to which value of this text field will be written.
    <li><code>textWithFileChooser</code> - the same as <code>text</code> element
    (including children of it), but has additional
    <code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Button</code> coming after SWT's text field.
    Pressing this button will result in opening
    <code>eu.geclipse.ui.dialogs.GridFileDialog</code>. Selection made in this dialog
    will be passed to SWT's text field.
    <li><code>list</code> - represents <code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Combo</code> widget.
    It extends <code>text</code> element, which means that it inherits all his
    children elements, but in addition has its own <code>value</code> and
    <code>writeable</code> sub-elements. In <code>value</code>s elements list content
    should be defined. <code>writeable</code> decides whether user will be able to
    edit SWT's combo's entries. 
    <li><code>multipleArguments</code> - control used to keep multiple values of
    one parameter. Values are kept in table
    (<code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Table</code>) - in which their String values are
    presented (because of the LabelProvider used). This table comes in together
    with 3 buttons: ``Add'' for adding new value and ``Edit'' and ``Remove''
    respectively for editing and deleting selected item. As for all components
    also for this one <code>paramName</code> should be defined to associate this
    control with JSDL element. Also the range of number of parameter's values
    can be determied - using <code>minArgumentsCount</code> and
    <code>maxArgumentsCount</code> elements.
    <li><code>textDataStaging</code> - the same as <code>textWithFileChooser</code>, but
    for chosen file also the <code>DataStaging</code> element in JSDL will be
    created. There is possibility to determine if this file should be staged in
    or out onto Grid by giving element <code>file</code> values ``in'' or ``out''
    respectively.
    <li><code>multipleDataStaging</code> - this is intended to combine
    textDataStaging with multipleArguments, but as for release 1.0 there's no
    support for this element.
  </ui> 
 </ui> 

<p><b>NOTE</b>: <code>paramName</code> element which must be defined for all of
  the components' element is the name of parameter that will be passed to
  application. This is done by adding name of the parameter to executable call
  of the application. In JSDL those values are represented by
  <code>jsdl-posix:Argument</code> elements.
