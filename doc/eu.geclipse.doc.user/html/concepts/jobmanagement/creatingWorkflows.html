<h1>Creating a Grid Workflow</h1>
<p>g-Eclipse comes with a graphical workflow builder that allows the building of complex 
workflows. These workflows can then be submitted for execution to different workflow engines
supported by the various grid middleware. The workflow builder is still under heavy 
development but is included in this release to receive initial feedback relating to its 
look &amp; feel and usage. </p>

<p>To get started with creating a workflow, right-click on the 'Workflows' folder in a 
Grid Project and choose <b>New &gt; Workflow Diagram</b>. This will open up the New Workflow
Wizard page where you will be prompted to enter a name for your workflow. The filename should
have an extention of <i>.workflow</i>. On clicking <b>Finish</b>, the the newly created workflow is 
opened in the workflow editor. </p>

<p>You can add a workflow job by selecting <b>Workflow Job</b> from the Palette on the right and
clicking in the empty editor area. A rectangular box (representing a job) appears in the editor 
and you can give the job a name by typing it in the text area. Next, you can add an Output
port to the workflow job by selecting <b>Output Port</b> from the Palette and then clicking 
in the workflow job. A little dark-blue box appears, showing that your job now has an Output Port.
Following a similar procedure, you can add another job to the workflow and add an Input Port to
it. Then, select <b>Link</b> from the palette, click on the Output Port of the first job, drag 
the pointer until you reach the Input Port of the second job and release. The two so far 
independent jobs are now linked to form a simple workflow.
