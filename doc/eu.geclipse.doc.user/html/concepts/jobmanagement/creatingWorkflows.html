<h1>Creating a Grid Workflow</h1>
<p>g-Eclipse comes with a graphical workflow builder that allows the building of complex 
workflows. These workflows can then be submitted for execution to different workflow engines
supported by the various grid middleware. </p>

<p>To get started with creating a workflow, right-click on the 'Workflows' folder in a 
Grid Project and choose <b>New &gt; Workflow Diagram</b>. This will open up the New Workflow
Wizard page where you will be prompted to enter a name for your workflow. The name should
have an extension of <i>.workflow</i>. On clicking <b>Finish</b>, the the newly created workflow is 
opened in the workflow editor. </p>

<p>A Workflow in g-Eclipse is stored in a dedicated folder that holds the .workflow file and any 
associated JSDL files that correspond to WorkflowJobs. In the 'Workflows' folder in your Grid Project, 
you can see the folder corresponding to your newly created workflow and, upon expanding it, you can 
see the '.workflow' file inside it. Any JSDL files you associate with Workflow Jobs will appear in this 
folder too.</p>

<p>You can add a workflow job by selecting <b>Workflow Job</b> from the Palette on the right and
clicking in the empty editor area. A rectangular box (representing a job) appears in the editor 
and you can give the job a name by typing it in the text area. Next, you can add an Output
port to the workflow job by selecting <b>Output Port</b> from the Palette and then clicking 
in the workflow job. A little blue box with an outward pointing arrowhead appears, showing that your 
job now has an Output Port. Following the same procedure, you can add another job to the workflow and 
add an Input Port to it, which is a little blue box with an inward pointing arrowhead. Then, select 
<b>Link</b> from the palette, click on the Output Port of the first job, drag 
the pointer until you reach the Input Port of the second job and release. The two so far 
independent jobs are now linked to form a simple workflow.</p>

<p>In order to associate your Workflow Jobs with JSDL files, you can right-click on any workflow job and
select 'Add Job Description'. You will be presented with a File dialog that will enable you to locate 
and choose a JSDL of your choice and select it. Alternatively, you could drag a JSDL file from the Grid
Projects View and drop it directly onto your workflow job. Notice that the JSDL file appears in the 
folder corresponding to the workflow in the Grid Projects View. (This JSDL file is a copy of the 
original and can be edited and used independently of the original.) If you feel the need to edit the 
JSDL file associated with any workflow job, you can right-click on the workflow job and select 
'Open Job in JSDL Editor'.</p>
