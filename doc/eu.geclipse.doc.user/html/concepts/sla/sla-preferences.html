<h1>g-Eclipse - SLA Preferences</h1>

<p>
Before the user can create SLA with a dedicated editor, he must enter a few 
data in the preference pages. Under the g-Eclipse tree node, there is an item
called SLA Editor. Depending on the role the g-Eclipse user 
plays, one has to enter the preferences for Consumer or Provider of 
Services. In the first field, enter the URI for the SLA Registry 
to which as Provider publishes his Service Level Templates and from 
which Consumers query potential Service offers. The other preference fields 
are the address of the consumer/provider. These values will be entered in the
SLT and SLA automatically later.
