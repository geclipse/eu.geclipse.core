<h1>g-Eclipse - NextGRID SLA Editor</h1>

<p>
The g-Eclipse framework hosted at Eclipse.org does NOT come with a SLA editor
due to licensing issues. But from the g-Eclipse project webpage (www.geclipse.eu)
an implementation for the SLA schema from the NextGRID project is available.
This editor is described briefly in the following section.  
</p>
<p>
Start the SLT wizard by selecting "New... Others ... Service Level Template" as
shown in the next picture. 
</p>

<p>
On the next wizard page you give the document a name with the extension *.slt. 
Then you have to specify the Service Type and a Name for this service as shown 
on the next wizard page and you click finish.

<p>
Now the SLA Editor for the NextGRID schema starts and the following main page 
is presented. The Editor is a multi-tab editor. The different tabs can be selected
by the tab of by the links on the main page. The SLA document is based on the 
NextGRID SLA XML schema and can be accessed directly with the more right tab.

<p>
With the tab "General Terms" the provider can enter his promised service
level terms. The most important fields are the name, obligation and the 
success criteria. The user can select from a list of possible criterias and enter
the values for success by clicking on the icon right from the value text field.

selects the corresponding action.</p>
