<h1>g-Eclipse - Service Level Agreements</h1>

<p>
In a future service-based IT landscape on the Grid or Cloud, the dynamic 
negotiation of provisioning and usage of services will play an important 
role. g-Eclipse provides an extensible framework for the negotiation of 
Service Level Agreements (SLA) between service providers and service consumers. 
</p>
<p>
The basic process of SLA negotiation contains the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>The service provider starts a service on Grid or Cloud infrastructures. 
  Depending on the infrastructure, such services can already be deployed as a 
  part of a Virtual Organisation or can be deployed in an ad-hoc manner. 
  <li> The service provider creates a Service Level Template (SLT) file 
  containing the QoS descriptions of the service offer. The SLT is stored on 
  the provider's system. 
  <li> The service provider publishes the SLT with the help of a service 
  registry. The service registry is similar to Yellow Pages.

  <li> A customer has a need for a given service and specifies the type of the 
  service and the required service terms (such as availability, response time, 
  bandwidth, number of accounts, etc.). 
  <li> With the help of the service requirements, the customer queries the 
  service level registry and gets the available services back ranked in order 
  of the requirments. She then select one of the offered SLTs. 
  <li> The selected SLT is enhanced with the customer's counterparty 
  information and a request for an SLA is sent to the service provider. 
  If the service provider agrees to the proposed SLA, the SLA gets executed 
  and the electronic contract is established. 
</ol>
</p>
<p> This process it supported by the generic g-Eclipse SLA framework in the
sense that it is independent from a specific SLA schema as well as from a 
specifc SLA negotiation implementations. The generic process does not support 
any specific SLA schema editor as in this moment of time it is not clear how a 
worldwide future SLA schema would look like. The step 1 of the SLA process is 
independent of any real implementation. In step 2 a dedicated SLA editor based 
on a dedicated SLA schema is used to create a Service Level Template (SLT), 
which can be seen as a service offer. With a specific implementation for SLA
schemas, the SLT editor can be opened. The following figure shows the example
for the NextGRID schema.

<p>When the SLT file is located on the workspace, the SLT can be published with 
a specific SLA negotiation implementation. The g-Eclipse SLA framework provides
as standardized UI popup-menu contribution for *.slt files to do so. Click on 
the SLT file and select <bold>SLA Management/Publish SLT to SLA registry</bold><br>
