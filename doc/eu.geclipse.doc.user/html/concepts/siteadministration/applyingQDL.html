<h1>g-Eclipse - Applying a Queue Description (QDL) configuration to the Batch Service</h1>

<p>Once created, a QDL file can be applied to the underlying Batch Service in order
for the queue configuration settings to take effect. The above functionality can
be invoked by selecting the action button named: <b>Apply Queue Configuration</b> on the
context menu. This action item is only visible when invoking the context menu
(right-click) on one or more QDL files in a Grid Project. The action item loads the Batch Service
Selection Wizard which is comprised of only one wizard page. </p>

<img src="images/BatchServiceSelectionWizard.png" alt="Batch Service Selection Wizard" width="500" >

<p>The wizard page is comprised of a CheckboxTreeViewer that displays
the running Batch service instances and the Batch Service type they
belong to in a parent-child style. As depicted on the image, there is
one batch service instance which is currently running (child) and this
instance belongs to a PBS Batch Service (parent).</p>

<p>Selecting a parent
type indicates that the configuration settings included in the selected
QDL file/s will be applied to all the running instances (children) that
belong to the specific type. Conversely, selecting a specific running
instance indicates that the configuration settings included in the
selected QDL file/s will be applied only to that instance. Selecting one
or more running instances enables the <b>Finish</b> button. Pressing the Finish
button applies the QDL configuration/s to the selected Batch Service
instances</p>
