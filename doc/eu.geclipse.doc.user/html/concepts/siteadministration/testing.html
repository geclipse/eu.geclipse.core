<h1>Testing Grid Resources</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Using g-Eclipse user can control state of resources
available in Virtual Organization, by performing different kinds of
tests on them. In g-Eclipse those tests can be delivered by
contributors, but built in in this release comes:</p>
<ol>
	Certificate lifetime test
</ol>
<ol>
    gLite version test
</ol>
<p>The main place form where all tests can be created, run and
managed is Tests view (Window > Show view > Other... > g-Eclipse >
Tests). All actions that can be applied to tests are available from this
"cockpit" and described below.</p>

<h2>Creating a new test</h2>
<p>To run a new test click "New Test Wizard" icon in upper-right
corner of the Tests view. This will open a New Test Wizard for you.
Wizard can be also opened in a standard way, through File > New... >
Other... > g-Eclipse > Grid Test Wizard.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/testwizard.png" alt="Tests view">

<p>On the first page of the wizard you have to choose what kind of
test you want to create (be aware that in case only one type of test is
available this page may not be displayed). The content of wizard depends
on the kind of test chosen on the first page. Different kind of tests'
wizards are described below.</p>
<p>Another option to create a test is to select resource(-s) you 
want to test under Virtual Organization node in Grid Project View.
Then from the context menu select <b>"Test ..."</b>. The "New Test Wizard"
will be opened. Some of the wizard pages may be omitted if you choose this
way of starting a test. For example common "Project Selection Page" and 
"Resource Selection Page" will not be shown, because all the data can be 
read from the selection.</p>
<h4>Certificate Lifetime Test</h4>
<p>Perform this kind of test if you want to check certificates
validity of services in your Virtual Organization. On the next page of
wizard you will be asked to choose a grid project from your workspace
(if you don't have any project, see this <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.doc.user/html/concepts/gridproject/creating.html">guide</a>
how to create one).</p>
<img border="0" src="images/testcert1.png" alt="Tests view">
<p>On the Resource Selection page you have to choose resources on
which services you want to test are located. You can choose more than
one resource by pressing Ctrl key.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/testcert2.png" alt="Tests view">
<p>Next page is the General Test Settings page on which you are
asked to provide name for your test and choose what kind of services you
would like to test for certificates validity.</p>
<p><i><b>Notice:</b></i> to test GridFTP service you have to have <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.doc.user/html/concepts/setup/cacertificates.html">CA
certificates</a> imported.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/testcert3.png" alt="Tests view">
<p>That was the last page of Certificate Lifetime Test's wizard.
Press finish and your test will appear in Tests view. Now you have to
run it.</p>
<h4>gLite version test</h4>
This test should be run by a user, when he wants to test if selected Computing
Element(s) support specified gLite version. 
<p>Pages of the gLite Version Test wizard are similar to the Certificate 
Lifetime Test wizard. You will need to :
<ol>1. Specify project.</ol>
<ol>2. Choose which resources of the selected project's Virtual Organization 
you want to test.</ol>
<ol>3. Select test name and version of the gLite.</ol></p>
<img border="0" src="images/testgLiteVersion.png" alt="Tests view"> 
<p>This test is a job-based test. In principle it creates proper jsdl (one 
for each node selected for testing) and scripts, which will be run on the grid. 
When user perform run action (see <i>Running a test</i> below) on the created 
test, jsdl is submitted to the selected node. Status of the job is refreshed 
every minute in background. When job finishes, output of the job is evaluated
and status of the test is displayed to the user. </p>
<h2>Running a test</h2>
<p>To run a test you simply choose Run from its context menu in
Tests view.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/testrunning.png" alt="Tests view">
<p>Test is run as a background job. Depending on kind of test and
number of tested resources it may take some time. To see progress of
running your test open Eclipse's Progress view.</p>
<p>Each test can be run many times.</p>
<h2>Viewing details of test</h2>
<p>After your test was successfully run you can see its details in
Tests View, Tests History View and standard Eclipse Properties view.</p>
<h4>Tests view</h4>
In corresponding columns:
<ul>
    Project - project, for which the test was created
</ul>
<ul>
	Status - overal test result
</ul>
<ul>
	Test date - date of last test run
</ul>
<ul>
	Type - the kind of test
</ul>
<h4>Test History view</h4>
<p>To open this view choose "Show details" from test's context menu
in Tests view. You can also go to Window > Show wiev > Other... >
g-Eclipse > Test History.</p>
<p>Test History view shows information about test that is selected
in Tests view.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/testdetails.png" alt="Tests History view">
<p>In Test History view you will see tests grouped by tested
resources. Each resource may have children - one for one test run.
Results for this test run are shown for each sub-test in column with
this sub-test's name. Even more details can be seen when you double
click single test result (the intersection of test run row and sub-test
column) - an editor will open with result description.</p>

<h2>Test display preferences</h2>
<p>In Test History view different test results have different colors
so it is more readable for user at first sight. Those colors can be
defined on Grid Tests preference page (Window > Preferences... >
g-Eclipse > Grid Tests).</p>
