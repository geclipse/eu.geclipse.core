<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>In the virtual folder named after the VO that is tied to your Grid Project you can browse the

<h2><a name="reachability">The Reachability Test</a></h2>

can stop this by clicking on the <b>"Stop"</b> button. In the  <b>"Logging"</b> tab you can see

<h2><a name="portScan">The Port Scan Test</a></h2>
<p>In this dialog you can test which ports are open on the selected resources. First you have to select 
and add various ports that you want to test. There are three ways to add ports that you want to scan. In the 
first you can select from the "standard" ports, like 21, and click <b>"Add Selected"</b>. In the second way
you can add rages of ports and click <b>"Add range"</b>. In the final way you can add specific ports and click
<b>"Add Port"</b>. The added ports will appear in the <b>"Selected Ports"</b>, in case you accidentally added 
some ports, these can be removed by selecting them and clicking <b>"Remove Port"</b> or click <b>"Remove All"</b> 
to remove all the ports in the list. </p>
<p>Once you have selected the ports that you want to scan, you click on <b>"Scan"</b>. Each of the hosts are 
scanned in parallel, and the result are shown as they are evaluated. If at any time during the scan you 
would like to abort it you just click on <b>"Stop"</b>. The result are shown in the <b>"Open Ports List"</b>
and you can click on the name of the various resources to see which ports are open for the specific 
resource. </p>
