<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Using g-Eclipse user can perform service job operations, which consist of testing,
monitoring, benchmarking and deploying applications, on resources
available in his or her Virtual Organization. g-Eclipse allows contributors to
write their own service jobs, but built in this release comes the following 
middleware independent test:</p>
<ol>
	Certificate lifetime test
</ol>

<p>Service jobs are associated with a dedicated view, called 
<b>Operator's Jobs</b> view (to open: <i>Window</i> > <i>Show view</i> > 
<i>Other...</i> > <i>g-Eclipse</i> >
<i>Operator's Jobs</i>). You can see this view with single service job created on
the screenshot below.</p>

<h2><a name="creating">Creating a New Service Job</a></h2>
<p>To run a new service job operation click <b>New Operator's Job Wizard</b> 
icon in upper-right corner of the <b>Operator's Jobs</b> view. 
This will open a <b>New Operator's Job Wizard</b> for you. Wizard can be 
also opened in a standard way, through <i>File</i> > <i>New...</i> >
<i>Other...</i> > <i>g-Eclipse</i> > <i>Operator's Job</i>.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/sjwizard1.PNG" alt="Operator's Job Wizard 1st Page">

<p>On the first page of the wizard (see screenshot above) you have to select 
a project in which you want to run service job in and provide a name for it.</p> 
<img border="0" src="images/sjwizard2.PNG" alt="Operator's Job Wizard 2nd Page">

<p>Second page (see screenshot above, <i>NOTE:</i> service jobs listed in the 
screenshot, which contains many middleware-specific service jobs, may differ 
with your list) lists all installed service jobs. 
User is asked to select one which he wants to perform</p>
<p>Contents of the next pages of the wizard differ depending on which 
service job type you selected on the previous page.</p>

<img border="0" src="images/sjgridprojcontext.PNG" 
alt="Starting Operator's Job from Project">
<p>Another option to create a service job operation is to select 
resource(-s) you want to run service jobs on under Virtual Organization 
node in <b>Grid Project View</b>. Then from the context menu select 
<i>"Run Operator's Job ..."</i> (see screenshot above). 

The <b>New Operator's Job Wizard</b> will be opened. 
Some of the wizard pages may be omitted if you choose this
way of creating service job operation. For example common 
<b>Project Selection Page</b> and <b>Resource Selection Page</b> will not 
be shown, because all the data can be read from the selection.</p>

<h4>Certificates Test</h4>
<p>Perform this kind of test if you want to check certificates
validity of services in your Virtual Organization. First two pages are as 
described above - select project which you want to run test in and  
name and type of the service job (<b>Certificates Test</b>).

<p>On the <b>Resource Selection Page</b> you have to choose resources on
which services you want to test are located. You can choose more than
one resource by pressing <i>Ctrl</i> key.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/certResources.PNG" 
alt="Selecting resources in Certificates Test">

<p>Next page is the <b>General Test Settings Page</b> on which you are asked to 
choose what kind of services you would like to test for 
certificates validity. In addition, you can manually add other services 
you want to test by specifying name and port of the service.</p>
<p><i><b>Notice:</b></i> to test GridFTP service you have to have <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.doc.user/html/concepts/setup/cacertificates.html">CA
certificates</a> imported.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/certLastPage.PNG" 
alt="General Test Setting page for Certificates Test">

<p>That was the last page of <b>Certificate Lifetime Test's wizard</b>.
Press finish and your test will appear in <b>Operator's Jobs</b> view. 
Now you have to run it.</p>

<h2><a name="running">Running Service Job</a></h2>
<p>To run a service job you simply choose <i>Run Operator's Job</i> from its context
menu in <b>Operator's Jobs</b> view.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/runningSJ.PNG" alt="Running Service Job">
<p>Service job is run as a background Eclipse task. Depending on type of 
service job and number of resources it may take some time.</p>
<p>Each service job can be run many times.</p>

<h2><a name="details">Viewing Details of Service Job</a></h2>
<p>After your service job was successfully started you can see its details in 
<b>Operator's Job History</b> and standard <b>Eclipse Properties</b> view.</p>
<h4>Operator's Jobs view</h4>
In corresponding columns:
<ul>
  <b>Project</b> - project, for which the service job was created
</ul>
<ul>
	<b>Status</b> - overall service job result
</ul>
<ul>
	<b>Job date</b> - date of last service job run
</ul>
<ul>
	<b>Type</b> - type of the service job
</ul>
<h4>Operator's Job History view</h4>
<p>To open this view choose <i>Show details</i> from service job's 
context menu in <b>Operator's Jobs</b> view. You can also go to <i>Window</i> >
<i>Show view</i> > <i>Other...</i> > <i>g-Eclipse</i> > 
<i>Operator's Job History</i>.</p>
<p><b>Operator's Job History</b> view shows information about service job that
is selected in <b>Operator's Jobs</b> view.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/sjHistory.PNG" alt="Operator's Job History view">
<p>In <b>Operator's Job History</b> view you will see service jobs grouped by 
specified resources. Each children of the resource node represents single 
started service job. Performing same service job results in adding another 
children to the resource node.</p>
<p>Each service job's specifies number of sub-tasks (sometimes only one) which are
needed for it to succeed. Results of the sub-tasks are shown in appropriate 
column in <b>Operator's Job History</b> view.</p>
<p>Even more details can be seen when you double click single service job result 
(the intersection of service job run row and sub-task column)
- an editor will open with result description.</p>

<h2><a name="display">Operator's Job Display Preferences</a></h2>
<p>In <b>Operator's Job History</b> view different service job results have different colors
so it is more readable for user at first sight. Those colors can be
defined on Operator's Jobs preference page (<i>Window</i> > <i>Preferences...</i>
> <i>g-Eclipse</i> > <i>Operator's Jobs</i>).</p>
