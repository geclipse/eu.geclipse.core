<h1>CA Certificates</h1>

<p>
CA Certificates (CA: Certificate Authority) are used to verify the identity
of a CA on the client side. The g-Eclipse framework itself comes currently
with support for PEM-encoded certificates. In order to access the Grid it is
often needed to import these certificates in g-Eclipse. This help section
describes how such certificates can be imported.

<h2><a name="fromRepository">Import from a Repository</a></h2>

<p>
The easiest way to import CA certificates is from a remote repository.
Currently g-Eclipse supports the EUGridPMA repository that can be found
at <a href="http://www.eugridpma.org">http://www.eugridpma.org</a>. To import
certificates from such a repository you have to open the
<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=eu.geclipse.ui.internal.preference.CaCertPreferencePage)")'>
<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
<b>g-Eclipse &gt; CA Certificates</b></a> preference page.
This page contains a list of all currently available CA certificates.

<p>
To import further certificates from a remote repository click
<b>Add from Repository...</b>. This will open the <b>CA Certificate Import Wizard</b>.

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/CACertWizard.png" alt="The g-Eclipse CA Certificate Import Wizard">

<p>
On the first page of this wizard you can select a certificate loader that
is used to import certificates. By default g-Eclipse comes with a certificate
loader for certificates hosted by the European Policy Management Authority
for Grid Authentication (EUGridPMA). After selecting a loader and clicking
<b>Next</b> a wizard page for specifying a repository URL will open.

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/CACertURLWizardPage.png" alt="The g-Eclipse CA Certificate URL Wizard Page">

<p>
In the <b>Repository URL Wizard Page</b> you have to specify a valid URL
pointing to a location where CA certificates can be found. Depending on the
certificate loader you have chosen on the wizard page before this field
may already be initialized with a reasonable URL. By clicking <b>Next</b>
the certificate loader is triggered to query the given URL for available
certificates. If no error occurs while contacting the specified URL the
next wizard page will appear with a list of all certificates that are
ready to be imported.

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/CACertListWizardPage.png" alt="The g-Eclipse CA Certificate List Wizard Page">

<p>
Now you can simply select the check box for each certificate you would like
to import and click <b>Finish</b>. After that the selected certificates are
downloaded, decompressed and imported into g-Eclipse. The preference page
will afterwards display the newly imported certificates.

<h2><a name="fromDirectory">Import from a Directory</a></h2>

To import further certificates from a local directory click
<b>Add from Directory...</b>. This will open the <b>CA Certificate Import Wizard</b>.

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/CACertDirWizard.png" alt="The g-Eclipse CA Certificate Import Wizard">

<p>
On the first page of this wizard you can select a certificate loader that
is used to import certificates. By default g-Eclipse comes with a certificate
loader for certificates hosted by the European Policy Management Authority
for Grid Authentication (EUGridPMA) and a certificate loader for simple PEM-based
certificates. After selecting a loader and clicking
<b>Next</b> a wizard page for specifying a local directory will open.

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/CACertDirWizardPage.png" alt="The g-Eclipse CA Certificate Directory Wizard Page">

<p>
In the <b>Local Direcory Wizard Page</b> you have to specify a valid directory
pointing to a location where CA certificates can be found. By clicking <b>Next</b>
the certificate loader is triggered to query the given directory for available
certificates. If no error occurs while listing the certificates contained in the
directory the next wizard page will appear with a list of all certificates that are
ready to be imported.

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/CACertDirListWizardPage.png" alt="The g-Eclipse CA Certificate List Wizard Page">

<p>
Now you can simply select the check box for each certificate you would like
to import and click <b>Finish</b>. After that the selected certificates are
imported into g-Eclipse. The preference page will afterwards display the newly
imported certificates.

<h2><a name="deleteCert">Delete Certificates</a></h2>

<p>
To delete one or multiple certificates simple open the
<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=eu.geclipse.ui.internal.preference.CaCertPreferencePage)")'>
<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
<b>g-Eclipse &gt; CA Certificates</b></a> preference page,
select the certificates you would like to delete and click
<b>Delete</b>. A dialog will then appear where you have to confirm that
you really would like to delete the selected certificates. After that
the selected certificates are permanently removed from the certificate list.
