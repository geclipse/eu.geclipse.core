<h1>The Certificate Info Dialog</h1>

To see the details of a certificate one can press the <b>Info</b> button on the
Security Preference Page. This will bring up the Certificate Info Dialog. This
dialog shows the details for a X.509 certificate in two tabs.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The following screenshot shows the overview tab of the Certificate Info Dialog:

</p>

<p>
This tab contains some basic information about the certificate (or the first
certificate of a certificate chain). It is divided in three sections: some general
information about the validity and the serial number of the certificate, a
section for the subject of the certificate ("Issued to") and a section for the
issuer of the certificate ("Issued from").

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>
The following screenshot shows the details tab of the Certificate Info Dialog:

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/CertificateInfoDialog_2.png" alt="The Certificate Info Dialog">
</p>

<p>
This tab contains much more information about the certificate than the overview
tab. In the upper part one can select the certificate of a certificate chain for
which the more detailed information below this part should be shown. The
certificate structure tree shows the structure of the selected certificate
including the certificate extension as defined for X.509 V3 certificates. By
selecting one of the items in the structure tree the corresponding information
is shown in the lower part of the dialog.
