<h1>Importing Trusted Certificates</h1>

<p>
To import a list of certificates into the g-Eclipse certificate manager you can
make use of the <b>Import...</b> button in the Security Preference Page. This
will bring up the Certificate Import Wizard. There you'll find a list of available
certificate repositories. This list is extensible with a dedicated extension point.
By default the list should look similar to the following screenshot:

</p>

<p>
Besides the various repositories of the Grid Policy Management Authorities this
list also contains the Gilda CA certificate that is mandatory for using the
Gilda training infrastructure.

<p>
By selecting one of the repositories and pressing <b>Next</b> the selected
repository is queried for available certificates. Depending on the internet
connection this may take some time. Afterwards the second wizard page is opened
showing the list of all certificates that are available in the formerly
specified repository:

</p>

<p>
Here one can now select the certificates that should be imported. When pressing
<b>Finish</b> the selected certificates will be downloaded and converted to the
format that is used internally by the certificate manager. The imported certificates
should then be visible in the Security Preference Page as certificates with trust
state "Always Trusted".
