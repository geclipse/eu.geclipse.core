<h1>Adding Trusted Certificates</h1>

<p>
To add one or more certificates to your list of trusted certificates, you can
use the <b>Add...</b> button in the Security Preference Page. This will bring
up the Grid File Dialog that allows you to browse either locally or remotely
(if remote connections have already been defined) for certificates to be
added to the certificate list. The selected certificates will be added with
trust state "Always Trusted" to the list of certificates, i.e. they will be
stored persistently.

<p>
This specific Grid File Dialog comes with various pre-defined file filters:
<ul>
<li><b>Base64 encoded certificate (*.0)</b>: Certificates that are encoded with
a Base64 algorithm. The file extension is commonly used by the Globus
Toolkit.
<li><b>Base64 encoded certificate (*.pem)</b>: Certificates that are encoded
with a Base64 algorithm. The file extension is the default one for Base64-encoded
certificates.
<li><b>DER encoded certificate (*.der)</b>: Certificates that are encoded with
a DER encoding.
<li><b>Base64 or DER encoded certificate (*.crt)</b>: The CRT file extension is
both used for Base64 and DER encoded certificates. 
</ul>
