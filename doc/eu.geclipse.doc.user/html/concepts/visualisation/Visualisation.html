<h1>Scientific Data Visualisation in g-Eclipse</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
<b>This is an overview page describing the the possibilities of data visualisation in g-Eclipse.</b>
</p> 

<p>
If you want to visualise scientific data sets computed on the Grid, 
you do not have to leave the g-Eclipse environment. The g-Eclipse project currently 
integrates two visualisation tools. You can download both through the Update Site.
<br> The first tool utilizes the well-known open source visualisation software 
system - <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">Visualisation Toolkit (VTK) from Kitware</a> and
allows one to build up a VTK data processing pipeline with the help of wizard and editor pages 
in a user friendly way. It handles local as well as remote rendering. In addition, it is
build to be extensible so if the desired functionality is not supported, it can be easily
added. For information on how to extend this module, please refer to the developer's help system.
<br> The second visulalisation tool is dedicated to visualising molecular structures. For this 
to be possible the SRS3D Visualization System is being used with it's full functionality being
available within g-Eclipse. For documentation on how to use this viewer, please refer to the
<a href="http://www.srs3d.org/Help/SRS3D_Quick_Reference_Card_1.1.pdf">Reference Card</a> on the 
<a href="http://www.srs3d.org/Help">SRS3D project website</a>.
