<h1>Creating a Connection</h1>

<p>
Connections in terms of g-Eclipse are meant to be links to local or remote
file systems. Such connections are seemlessly integrated into the Grid model
views. You can browse them, drag'n'drop data to or from them, create or delete
files and folders. In fact the g-Eclipse connection management is based on
EFS. That means that every EFS implementation is supported from scratch and
can therefore be used to create connections.

<p>
Connections are divided into local and global connections. Local connections
are located in the user's workspace and are therefore part of a project.
Local connections can be created by the appropriate context menu action
(see <a href="#local">Local Connections</a>). Global connections do not
exist within a project and can therefore also be created without even
having a project in your workspace (see <a href="#global">Global Connections</a>). 

<h2><a name="local">Local Connections</a></h2>

<p>
To create a new connection select the <b>New -> Grid Connection</b> action from
the Grid project view's context menu or select <b>File -> New -> Grid Connection</b>.
This will open the <b>New Connection Wizard</b>.

<p>
On the first page of the connection wizard you can choose the workspace location where
your new connection should be created and the name of the new connection. After clicking
<b>Next</b> you are directed to the second page of the connection wizard. Here you can
choose a protocol for which you want to create a new connection. The controls of the
second wizard page change with the protocol you select. For instance when selecting
a GSIFTP connection the page looks like this:

<p>
Whereas for a LFN connection it looks slightly different:

<p>

<p>
The controls therefore depend on the connection type, i.e. the scheme you are selecting.
Most often you will be asked for a host name, a host port and a path on that host.
Concerning the remote path the connection wizard offers the opportunity to create
a temporary connection to the specified host starting from the host's root directory.
To do so just click <b>create a temporary connection</b>. Now you are able to browse
the remote server and to select a directory you would like to connect to. When selecting
a directory you may notice that the path field changes its value to the selected
directory. If you finalized your settings just click <b>Finish</b> and the new 
connection will be created afterwards.

<h2><a name="global">Global Connections</a></h2>

<p>
Global connection can be created from the connection view.

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/ConnectionView.png" alt="The Connection View">

<p>
There you either choose <b>New Connection</b> from the context menu or click
the appropriate button
(<img border="0" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.geclipse.ui/icons/etool16/newconn_wiz.gif" alt="New Connection Button">)
in the views tool bar. This will open the <b>New Connection Wizard</b>. On the first
wizard page you are asked for a name for your new connection.

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/ConnectionWizardNamePage.png" alt="The Connection View">

<p>
When entering the name and clicking <b>Next</b> you will be directed to the second
wizard page that is actually the same as for <a href="#local">local connections</a>.
