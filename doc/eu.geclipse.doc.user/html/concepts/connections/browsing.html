<h1>Browsing Remote Sites</h1>

<p>
Browsing of remote sites is as simple as browsing a local directory.
The only thing that has to be taken into account is that proper remote
site browsing is only possible from Grid model views (i.e. Grid project
view, connection view ...). Within these views you are able to expand
directories and to list their children. As of course g-Eclipse has to
connect to the underlying remote machine browsing of such connections
is on the one hand much slower than browsing your local file system and
may on the other hand need some kind of authentication. If some
authentication is needed g-Eclipse will ask you to create a new
suitable authentication token and will guide you through the process
of creating such a token.

<p>
Here is a list of actions that are in principle available for remote
files and folders:

<ul>
  <li>List content of directories (Expand tree node)</li>
  <li>Open a file for editing (Double click file or choose <b>Open</b> from context menu)</li>
  <li>Save a file after it was changed in the editor (Choose <b>Save</b>)</li>
  <li>Copy and paste files and directories (Context Menu Actions)</li>
  <li>Drag and Drop files and directories from within a Grid model view
      and among different Grid model views</li>
  <li>Create new files and folders in a remote directory (Context Menu Actions)</li>
  <li>Delete existing files and folders (Context Menu Actions)</li>
</ul>

Which if these actions are really available strongly depends on the
underlying EFS implementation.

<p>
The easiest way to browse connections and to transfer data from one
connection to another is to use the <b>Grid Exploring Perspective</b>.

<p>

<p>
This perspective comes with two instances of the connection view that
by default are arranged side by side. That makes it very easy to open
a connection on one connection view, another connection on the other
view and then to drag and drop files from one connection to the other.
The progress view at the very bottom of the perspective shows all
active file transfers. Furthermore it provides the editor area that
may be used to open files, to edit them on the fly and to afterwards
save them back.
