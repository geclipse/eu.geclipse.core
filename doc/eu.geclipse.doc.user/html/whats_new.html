</head>
<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<h1>What's new in g-Eclipse</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>g-Eclipse 1.0 M8</b>
  <ul>
    <li>It is now possible to associate a keystore with a GRIA VO, allowing seamless
        access to different servers from different projects</li>
    <li>It is now possible to associate an access ID with an AmazonWS VO, allowing the
        use of different accounts at the same time</li>
    <li>One may choose any kind of file accessible by g-Eclipse as a source in the jsdl
        for GRIA jobs: local files, GRIA data stagers, gridFTP, SRM, LFC, etc.</li>
    <li>The workflow component in g-Eclipse has a number of improvements:
      <ul>
        <li>Each Workflow is now stored in a dedicated folder which holds the .workflow
            file as well as the JSDL files corresponding to each Workflow Job
            (Note: the <strong>.workflow</strong> extension is still explicitly
            required when creating the workflow)</li>
        <li>To associate a Workflow Job with a JSDL file, one can either select the
            action via a right-click context menu on the Workflow Job or simply drag
            and drop a JSDL file from the Grid Projects View onto the Workflow Job in question</li>
        <li>The JSDL file associated with any Workflow Job can be opened and edited in
            the JSDL Editor via the Workflow Job context menu, directly from the
            graphical workflow editor</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>The trace view was added, allowing to analyse communication traces of MPI programs.
        Currently it supports:
      <ul>
        <li>Reading traces in the NOPE trace file format</li>
        <li>Displaying traces in a lamport and in a physical clock view</li>
        <li>Setting breakpoints in traces and using them for debugging in MPI programs</li>
        <li>Displaying simple trace statistics</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>... and, as always, a lot of bug fixes!</li>
  </ul>

  <li><b>g-Eclipse 1.0 M7</b>

  	<li>First implementation of parametric jobs (sweep extension of jsdl): it is possible to submit
  	    such parametric jobs both to gLite and GRIA</li>
  	<li>GRIA data stagers are now represented as files</li>
  	<li>It is possible to open Output Data Stagers for GRIA jobs</li>
  	<li>As source for the input stager in GRIA jobs a GRIA stager can now also be specified</li>
  	<li>Online help now also contains Concepts from the middleware's point of view</li>
  	<li>... and of course a lot of bug fixes</li>
  </ul>

  	<li>It is possible to specify port in Certificate test</li>
  	<li>Two resource simple tests, ping and dns lookup, are implemented</li>
    <li>... and of course a lot of bug fixes</li>

  <ul>
  	<li>Possibility to choose the job name and target folder when submitting a job</li>
  	<li>Deleting a job from the local workspace gives the user the possibility of also removing it from the Grid</li>
  	<li>GRIA job submission can now deal directly with local input files</li>
  	<li>Job Details view shows now GRIA specific information</li>
    <li>Improved GRIA Site Administrator editor</li>
    <li>Test framework for grid resources with two implemented tests: certificate lifetime and gLite version</li>
