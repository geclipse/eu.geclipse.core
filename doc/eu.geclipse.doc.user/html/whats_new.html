                        The CA certificates handling has been replaced by a new Trusted
                        Certificates functionality, which unifies the handling of trusted
                        certificates among different middlewares

                        SFTP is now supported as a native Eclipse filesystem implementation,
                        allowing to transparently transfer files between SFTP locations and

                    <li>
                        GridFTP now supports third-party transfers, copying files directly
                        between the source and destination hosts if these are different from
                        the local machine.

                        Support is now added for benchmarks. Benchmarks are created and run
                        as operator's jobs, and their results can be browsed using the new
                        Benchmark View. Currently only one benchmark is provided (flops) but
                        another one shall be implemented soon.

                                Each Workflow is now stored in a dedicated folder which holds the .workflow 
                                file as well as the JSDL files corresponding to each Workflow Job
                                (Note: the <strong>.workflow</strong> extension is still explicitly
                                required when creating the workflow)

                                To associate a Workflow Job with a JSDL file, one can either select the
                                action via a right-click context menu on the Workflow Job or simply drag
                                and drop a JSDL file from the Grid Projects View onto the Workflow Job in question
                            </li>

                                the JSDL Editor via the Workflow Job context menu, directly from the
                                graphical workflow editor
