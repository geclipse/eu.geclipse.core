<h1>g-Eclipse Prerequisites</h1>

<p> The g-Eclipse framework provides an eco system for seamless access to 
Grid and Cloud infrastructures in science and in business. Such distributed 
infrastructures are gaining popularity worldwide. Grid and Cloud infrastructures 
are distributed resources, which are connected by a Middleware layer. 
This Middleware layer provides a secure and seamless access to distributed 
computing and storage resources. </p>

<p> In order to access a Grid or Cloud infrastructure, you must contact the 
resource provider. From the resource provider you get information 
about identity tokens, interfaces to the infrastructure service, accounting, etc. 
Therefore, you need <b>an agreement</b> with an infrastructure before 
you continue with g-Eclipse <b>first</b>.</p>

<p> The procedure differs between the different infrastructure providers and 
middleware systems. For more details about the first step, have a look in the 
middleware specific documentation sections. </p>
