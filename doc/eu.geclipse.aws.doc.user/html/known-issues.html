<h1>g-Eclipse - AWS Known Issues</h1>

<ul>
  <li><h4>Unsetting the Proxy:</h4>
	When choosing a proxy server in the Eclipse preferences, the AWS component
	doesn't allow to unset it. This means, once the proxy is set it is
	always used for accessing AWS services until g-Eclipse is restarted.
	</li>
  <li><h4>Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket naming:</h4>
  Bucket names in S3 live in a flat namespace and have to follow some rules.
  g-Eclipse currently doesn't check these rules when you ask to create a new
  bucket. This means:
  <ul>
    <li>Bucket names are global, you will not be able to name a bucket "test"
    if another S3-user already used that name! (even if you cannot see nor
    access his/her bucket). It is recommended that you prepend your bucket
    names with your Amazon ID or your name to avoid collisions.
    </li>
    <li>When creating a bucket which is not located in the US but in Europe,
    then its name has to be DNS compatible: that means that the name must be
    longer than 3 and shorter than 256 characters, and must contain only
    <b>lower-case</b> letters, hyphens ("-") or full-stops (".").
    </li>
  </ul> 
	</li>
</ul>
