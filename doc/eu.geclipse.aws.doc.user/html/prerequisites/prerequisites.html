<h1>AWS middleware prerequisites</h1>

<p> The g-Eclipse framework provides seamless access to Cloud infrastructures of
Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS contains a suite of services for building 
applications, were the g-Eclipse AWS implementation currently support the Simple
Storage Service (S3) and the Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2). 

</p>
<p> Access to S3 and EC2 resources is based on a valid user account at Amazon. 
In order to use g-Eclipse with the Cloud services from Amazon the following 
requisites must be fulfilled.
<ul>
  <li>A g-Eclipse user needs an valid general account at Amazon. That is the 
  same account that can be used for non-Cloud services as AWS. 
  <li>The user must register himself for the S3 and EC2 services at Amazon Cloud
  Webservice (AWS). Find more information
  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">here</a>.
  <li> In order to use the AWS systems, the user must know his Access Identifiers. 
  Find them under "Your Account --> Access Identifiers" on the AWS web page after
  your login. You need to know your "Access Key ID" and the "Secret Access Key". 
</ul>
