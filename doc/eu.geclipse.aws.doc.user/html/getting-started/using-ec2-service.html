<h1>Using the EC2 Service</h1>

<p>After we have created an <a href="setting-up-aws-support.html">AWS
Virtual Organization</a> we can now use these facilities to interact with
the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).</p>
<p>The main entry point to working with the EC2 Service is the Grid
Project found in the "Grid Project" view. The Grid Project displays all
the physically existing folders on the local computer as well as a
virtual view of the information provided by the underlying Virtual
Organization.</p>

<h2>Finding the Available Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</h2>

<p>When working with the EC2 service it is desirable to be informed
about the available Amazon Machine Images. To display a list of AMIs,
which can be started, we select <code>Services -> Images</code> in our
AWS VO. Via this tree branch we can choose to display a list of all
available Amazon machine images, a list of images which we are given
explicit access to (eg. another user has given us access to his image)
or a list of image we have created.</p>

<p><img src="images/grid-project-view-expanded-ami-list.jpg"
	border="0" alt="Grid Project showing a list of available AMIs"></p>

<h2>Running an AMI</h2>
<p>To launch any of the AMIs in the provided lists, right-click on
the AMI and select "Launch AMI". This opens the launch dialog with the
main tab active.</p>

<p><img src="images/ami-launch-dialog-tab-main.jpg" border="0"
	alt="The Launch dialog with the Main tab active"></p>

<p>The AMI configuration is ready to be launched with its default
configuration. Most likely you will want to customize several of the
options presented in the Main tab. The following options can be set:</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td>AWS Access ID</td>
		<td>The access id specifies the AWS account to launch the AMI
		with.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>AMI ID</td>
		<td>The ID of the AMI to launch. Is taken from the context of the
		selected AMI but can be any valid AMI ID.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Min</td>
		<td>The minimum number of AMIs to launch. If EC2 can not provide
		the required number, the launch is cancelled.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Max</td>
		<td>The maximum number of launched AMIs desired.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Key</td>
		<td>The key specifies the login credentials on the launched
		instance.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Security Group</td>
		<td>The security group allows or denies access to certain
		communication channels (e.g. ports).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Zone</td>
		<td>The geographical zone where to place the EC2 instance.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Instance Type</td>
		<td>The instance type denotes the hardware configuration of the
		instance to launch.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Since some of these options are sensitive to the EC2
configuration associated with the AWS credentials, it is possible to
fetch the possible values of the Key, Zone and Instance Type fields.
Clicking on the "Populate from EC2" button in the lower right contacts
the EC2 Service to obtain these values.</p>

<p>Also of particular interest is the "Parameter" tab. It allows to
send instance specific details to the set of launched AMIs. The so
called User Data can either be send via plain text or by providing a
binary file. The binary file is not allowed to exceed a limit of 16KB.</p>
<p>The User Data can be retrieved from within a running instance via
a HTTP call to an EC2 internal server. A common scenario is to use the
user data to setup instance specific configuration details like starting
services, modifying/providing configuration files etc. The
interpretation of the provided User Data is up to the running instance
and beyond the scope of the EC2 infrastructure.</p>
<p>For further information regarding the configuration process refer
to: <a

Parameterized Launches to Customize Your AMIs</a>.

	alt="The Launch dialog with the Parameter tab active"></p>


<p>As with any other launch dialog, it is possible to save the
settings by clicking "Apply" or to physically launch the entity by
clicking the "Launch" button.</p>

<h2>Displaying all Running Instances</h2>

<p>Once an instance is launched it is enlisted in the list of all
running instances belonging to the particular user. The list is found in
the AWS VO under the <code>Computing</code> branch. The list displays
the id of the running instance, the AMI id from which the instance
originated and its current status. The status can have one of the
following values:</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td>pending</td>
		<td>The instance is booting up.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>running</td>
		<td>The instance is running and can be accessed</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>shutting-down</td>
		<td>The instance is shutting down</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>terminated</td>
		<td>The instance has been shut down and can not be accessed
		anymore</td>
	</tr>
</table>

	border="0" alt="The grid project view with running instances"></p>

<h2>Obtaining Information</h2>

<p>The EC2 elements listed in the AWS VO are able provide some
configuration details. To view these details, the "Properties" view is
used. The following figure shows the "Properties" view displaying static
metadata information for a launched EC2 instance. A similar layout
exists for AMI properties, Security Groups, Keypairs, Elastic IPs etc.</p>

<p><img src="images/properties-view-instance.jpg" border="0"
	alt="The properties view showing details of running instance"></p>

<h2>Logging in via SSH</h2>

<p>Once an instance is launched g-Eclipse offers the possibility to
access this machine via a SSH shell. In order to use this connection
method, the security group used to launch the AMI has to open the port
22 (ssh default port). Because the ssh connection method uses the
eclipse connection infrastructure, the ssh private key has to be
inserted into the list of available keys. Therefore the preference page
<code>General -> Network Connections -> SSH2</code> is used to insert
the private key which has been obtained when creating the key.</p>

<p><img src="images/preferences-ssh.jpg" border="0"
	alt="The preferences page of the SSH2 details"></p>

<p>To connect to the running instance choose "Open SSH terminal..."
in the context menu of an instance. This opens the SSH login data
dialog, with the correct external DNS name inserted into the form. The
only thing to be provided is the login name which is "<code>root</code>".
There is no need for a password, since it is contained within the ssh
private key.</p>

<p><img src="images/dialog-ssh-credentials.jpg" border="0"
	alt="Dialog for ssh login details"></p>

<p>Clicking "Finish" opens the "Terminal" view and starts the login
sequence.</p>

<p><img src="images/ssh-terminal.jpg" border="0"
	alt="The ssh terminal after login"></p>

<h2>Terminating an Instance</h2>

Once a running instance is no longer needed, it can be shut down. To
terminate an instance, the "Terminate Instance" menu entry from the
context menu of a running EC2 instance is used. This sends a shutdown
signal to the running instance, initiating the shutdown sequence. In
conclusion the state of the instance transitions into "shutting-down",
followed by "terminated" once the shutdown procedure has finished.


<h2>What's next?</h2>
There is much more to explore in the world of gEclipse and the AWS
infrastructure. Explore the AWS VO tree, and use the context menu actions
to use and administer your EC2 and S3 system.
