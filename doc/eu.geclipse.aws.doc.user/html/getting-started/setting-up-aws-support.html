<h1>Setting Up AWS Support</h1>

<p>This help page will show you how to setup the Amazon Webservice
(AWS) support within g-Eclipse. In order to access any of the features
provided by the AWS infrastructure, you need to take some precautions.</p>

<h2>Create a Virtual Organization</h2>

<p>To display the information provided by the AWS services you
should set up an AWS Virtual Organization (AWS VO). Although some
functionality can be leveraged without an AWS VO, it is generally a good
idea to create one.</p>

<p>Following the workflow proposed by the g-Eclipse framework we
embed our AWS VO into a Grid Project. To create a Grid Project we use
the "Grid Project Wizard" which can be found in the "New Wizard Dialog"
under <code>g-Eclipse -> Grid Project</code></p>

<p><img src="images/create-grid-project-wizard.jpg" border="0"
	alt="Creating a Grid Project"></p>

<p>Click on the "Next" button and on the following wizard page you
simply provide a project name and click "Next" again. We are now at the
place where we associate our Grid Project with an AWS Virtual
Organization.</p>

<p><img src="images/VO-selection-page.jpg" border="0"
	alt="Select a VO"></p>

<p>As we can see there is currently no Virtual Organization present
in the System. Therefore we hit the "Edit VOs..." button which brings us
to the preference page under <code>g-Eclipse -> VO-Declarations</code>.</p>

<p><img src="images/VO-declarations-preference-page.jpg" border="0"
	alt="List of declared VOs"></p>

<p>To add a Virtual Organization, we click the corresponding "Add"
button in the upper right corner, which brings us to a dialog showing
all the available VO types.</p>

<p><img src="images/create-new-VO.jpg" border="0"
	alt="List of available VO types"></p>

<p>After selecting the AWS VO, we are faced with the first wizard
page, allowing us to configure our own AWS VO. At first we have to
provide a unique name to identify the AWS VO. Next we input the AWS
access id of our AWS account. The table at the bottom of the dialog
displays a list of all currently installed AWS services, which we can
facilitate from within g-Eclipse.</p>

<p><img src="images/aws-vo-dialog.jpg" border="0"

<p>After we have filled in all the desired details we click "Finish"
in this VO wizard page. We are again faced with the preferences, which
we close by hitting "OK", leaving us with the "New Wizard Dialog", where
we can choose our configured AWS Virtual Organization.</p>

<p>By selecting this VO and hitting the "Finish" button we associate
the newly created Grid Project with the chosen AWS VO. In the "Grid User
Perspective" we find our newly created grid project in the "Grid
Projects" view.</p>

<h2>Providing AWS User Credentials</h2>

<p>To provide content for the Virtual Organization, the AWS VO will
need to contact the Amazon Webservices. If a request of such type
occurs, the user also has to provide his AWS secret id as found on the <a
	href="http://www.amazonaws.com/">aws website</a>. The user can create
such an authentication token by utilizing the "Authentication Tokens"
view or wait until he explicitly needs to interact with the Amazon
Webservices, in which case he will be asked to provide his secret id.</p>

<p>When using the "Authentication Tokens" view, the user selects the
"Add" wizard from the views toolbar and chooses "AWS Credentials". Once
the "Authentication Token" wizard opens up, the user is faced with the
following dialog:</p>

<p><img src="images/auth-token-vo-select-page.jpg" border="0"
	alt="VO selection page in authentication token wizard"></p>

<p>When an interaction with the Amazon Webservice is initialized by
g-Eclipse and there is no fitting token present, the corresponding
Wizard is opened automatically. If a valid token already exists, the
wizard does not pop up but the existing token is used.</p>

<p>An authentication token is bound to a specific VO and therefore
the user might have to choose its destination VO here. After selecting the
appropriate one and clicking "Next", the user is faced with the form to
input his AWS credentials.</p>

<p><img src="images/auth-token-aws-creds-page.jpg" border="0"

<p>Once "Finished" is clicked, the newly created token is shown in
the "Authentication Tokens" list.</p>
