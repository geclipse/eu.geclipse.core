# g-Eclipse - Tools for Grid and Cloud Computing

g-Eclipse is a framework that allows users and developers to access arbitrary 
computing infrastructures. What was called *Grid computing* a few years ago 
is now called *Cloud computing*. The differences between the two approaches 
are not so big, but both infrastructures come with the challenge to access 
the resources in a unified way. That is what g-Eclipse provides. 

The *g* in the name comes from *Grid*, but the g-Eclipse framework itself 
is independent from a certain Grid infrastructure or Cloud Computing provider. 

The g-Eclipse project maintains a set of connectors to Grid middlewares and 
provides an adapter to the Amazon webservices EC2 and S3.

## g-Eclipse Core Repository

This is the main Git repository with the core components of the g-Eclipse Project.
It includes the core libraries and connectors to AWS EC2 and S3.

The Git repository has been migrated from the original Subversion repository
hosted at eclipse.org at http://dev.eclipse.org/svnroot/technology/eu.geclipse.
